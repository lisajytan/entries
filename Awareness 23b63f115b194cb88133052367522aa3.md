The best thing about reflection is that it brings about awareness. Awareness of what I am doing and what I'd like to change. I have been skipping my daily 5min in the past few days. And I think that's because I haven't been accomplishing everything that I set myself to do. And this disappointment is something I don't want to face. It's better to not think about it than to face it and deal with it. WRONG. So, I'm grateful for getting back to my daily 5min again, and have awareness of what's going on. 

# No-Judgement Zone

There is no "right or wrong". Just whether the actions are advancing me towards my goals or not. And this action is not. So having awareness is not beating myself up about "damn you. Why can't you be a better, more structured person". Instead, this awareness means **"alright girl, I know we are all stress and under some pressure. And sometimes, we don't finish everything we set ourselves to do. It's ok. Let's reassess and figure out how to improve from there!"**.

The awareness is just a little no-judgement checkpoint to just look at the now and see where we are. It's like the space shuttle heading towards the moon. If the current path deviates a little from the ideal path, just slightly change it and be on the way to the moon. Awareness is to realise the path, and do the tiny baby readjustments. 

# Awareness, Acceptance, Action

Awareness has been a foundational principle in my life for ages now. I used to have this thing called the 3A method. Awareness, Acceptance and Action. Now, it's just awareness of an issue and new action towards it. 

Nothing is a failure. Everything is a feedback. Listen to the message between the lines. And take new actions.
