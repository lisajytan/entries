> If you’re trying to break a habit, don’t say ‘this is the last time I’m doing it’ to yourself. Instead, say ‘this is the first time I’m not doing it’.

Someone asked me recently on how do I know and track my progress over the years. There is no empirical test, just me reflecting every day, seeing what good habits I made and what bad habits I kicked. 

I have never thought about killing myself because life sucks, but I've read a quote somewhere about if you want to kill yourself, just kill the bad part of yourself. It resonated very well with me, because there are some parts of Lisa that I really do not like. And I realised I don't have to live with that part of Lisa. For example, the Lisa that doesn't love anyone. She's long gone. I killed her and brought a brand new Lisa who is very much in love with everyone and everything she sees! 

Some habits are hard to kick. I know that because I am spending 10+ years kicking the bad habits and start better ones. 

- Sometimes, it helps by rationally deciding to do the right thing instead
- Or it helps by saying out loud what I am going to do, then hear it in my head and realised that is silly
- Now, I'm going to add this "this is the first time I'm not doing it"

This will be very applicable to wanting to snack at night or to stop a bad habit. Let's try! And see if this new method works!

Love,
