At the end of each quarter, I personally do a simple self-reflection to check in on where I am and where I go. I’d like to invite you to do the same for your personal life. 

> I will keep constant watch over myself and‚ most usefully‚ will put each day up for review. — Seneca

# Why we self-reflect

There’s a concept in aviation called the 1-in-60 Rule.

It says that a 1 degree error in heading will cause a plane to miss its target by 1 mile for every 60 miles flown.

Small miss now, large miss later.

This highlights the need for real-time course correction and adjustment.

# This is how I do it

I do this because it helps me to keep myself in check and aligned. Here, I look at 3 segments. See my quarterly template ➡️

1. Personal check in 
2. General quarterly questions 
3. A paragraph of general reflections
