> When things arenâ€™t adding up in your life, start subtracting.

Had this in my principle for a while now but have not been applying until recent few months. 

*Proof that I am only human and I don't always apply the lessons immediately. It takes time. Good things take time.*

I was inspired by this video from ASAPScience. When we think of solving problems, we keep finding new solutions, new ways, new additions. However, the simple truth is that sometimes, subtraction is the answer. 

My first taste of subtraction in in Q2 this year. I realised ED was doing too much and we needed to subtract so as to focus. Yes, they are all interlinked focus, but in the **right now**, just 2 things will do. So I subtracted and it helped boost our productivity so much more! 

At the end of every month, I also chat with the team 1-on-1. We think about what to subtract and remove. And that has helped so much. We focus better and we work together this way. I'm so in love with this new lesson learnt! They also know best since they are in the field. 

Subtract. We have more than enough. With abundance, you balance the forces with subtraction.
