> Oh but how could I settle for mundane life when my life is anything but mundane?
> 

I'm spoilt with the fast and efficient trains in Hong Kong, the 24/7 trains in Berlin and Rome, the beautiful beaches in Greece and the Philippines, the natural beautiful in Guilin, gorgeous architecture in Europe and stunning mountains in Switzerland and North India. I've seen and realized things that I don't have. Now I can't settle for anything less than the best and that's not good.

My life is an ongoing adventure, with the kindest souls, the craziest parties and the most beautiful adventure. Balsamic in Modena, olives in Delphi, dolphins in Mauritius, footprints in Angkor Wat, camping in Sydney, biking in Leiden, snowstorm in Manhattan, wine yards in Stellenbosch, little Mr Foxy in Shoreditch. When life is so beautiful, it's hard to fall asleep for dreams are not as good as the real life. 

My heart is full â€” not because of the adventures and amazing life, but because of the people in it. The rooftop Tsingtao, the cafe sundays, the single malt and talks. 

1920, life without Lisa, is gatherings in Vienna cafes. 

2020, life with Lisa, is rooftop adventures, beers by the river and single malt any time (and via zoom). 

Every single day, I still can't believe I have these amazing friends in my life. I still can't believe that **they chose** me to be their friends too. My heart has been overflowing with happiness lately. And I'm so grateful, so very grateful. 

## I'm Afraid

So I don't know what to do moving forward. I've had der beste life. And it keeps getting better every day. Experiences redefine expectation. And I'm so afraid. I'm afraid that I will have to settle. To settle for a mundane life, a mundane husband, a mundane family. 

I'm also afraid. That one day, life wouldn't be as beautiful anymore. Well, at least I know the past is real and I can always take my time machine to indulge in the memory. 

I fear that the future might not live up to what I am living now. 

But the last 10 years has been proving me wrong. Each year keeps getting better than before. So let's see! I've got my eyes on you, future. So excited about you!

Love,
