Nature is the greatest teacher. As the season shifts from winter to spring, I can’t help but embrace the change I see. Change is the only constant, but it can be challenging to accept it. This period of my life is in a constant state of change, and seeing how nature embraces it is really powerful. 

# Change is not pretty

As the ground comes to view again, the snow melts away and the sun lingers a little longer, I know it’s mud season. Mud season is not always the prettiest. Your boots get soaked, you neither get snowy grounds nor flower breezes. Instead, everything is mushy and brown. 

But it is then, where I learn to love it. This is a necessary step in this change of seasons. Changes are not always pretty, but they lead to beautiful pretty things like flowers in spring. We learn to love it and enjoy this phase. 

# My change

This reflects very well on the change coming in my life. As we continue to grow, I am noticing that the change in seasons happen more frequently. I finally embrace this new “season”, only to anticipate a new challenge and change. It can be stressful but it is all good. 

One big thing right now is to really experience this change of season. Whilst I logically understand and accept it, to fully experience it can bind this phase more concretely in my head. A change in season, a shift in environment, a clarity in the intentions and goals. To experience that with Mother Nature is just an honour. 

Life is the furtherest thing from ceteris peribus.

Love,
