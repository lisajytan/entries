> “And lastly from that period I remember riding in a taxi one afternoon between very tall buildings under a mauve and rosy sky; I began to bawl because I had everything I wanted and knew I would never be so happy again.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald

This quote struck me today, for I was reading the exact quote last year. Last year was simply too amazing; travels, friends (they’re actually family) and adventures. Worried would be the right word to use; I was worried. I was worried that I could never have all of these again. The love, the energy, the adventures, the freedom, the insanity, everything that makes life perfect; I had them all. I never knew I could be this happy with everything I wanted. Everything was simply too perfect to be true.

This too shall pass. So here’s the other thing about having such perfection in your life. You realize that it never lasts. It was goodbyes after goodbyes, hugs, farewells and tears. I thought, well that’s it, that’s the end of the peak of my life, it’s downhill from hereon. I will never be that happy again.

But guess what? Here we are, approaching the end of July. It’s only been half of the year and my life is in another cycle of amazing. Yes, it is never like the past, but that is what makes every moment special. Last year was about exploring, moving out of the comfort zone and experiencing. This year is about growth, about moving forward and about new adventures. The new stories, the new achievements, the insane adventures and there is only more to come.

Do you know what I’ve learnt? Life only gets better. If you want something badly enough, go out and do it. The universe will help you with all its power and you will get it. Here’s to the next half of the year. May it be filled with adventures, laughter and tons of amazing memories.
