***Something About “I Like You"***

I come to realise something about love. (Also because I overheard Alex telling Nicky about how fascinating he is by me and how he likes me so much.) Just because I am different and I know what I want, doesn’t mean that I am right for the person.

# Experiences

Most, if not all, the men in my life values me for who I truly am, instead of the usual complaints you hear online — sexualising, objectifying, etc. In fact, I was thinking about rejections lately. I receive lots of rejections because "I respect you too much". Well, that is a good problem to have.  Nonetheless, I have been rejected many times like that.

So, I don’t know if it’s common, but I get “I like you” very quickly from people. And I’ve had at least 3 people saying to my face that I’m the one/the perfect one. And a few others saying it indirectly. And others saying it behind my back. I know I’m special, in the sense that my personality is unique and it’s unlike most girls. That being said, I dont trust the “I like you”.

At the end, I think they like the **idea** of me. A unicorn gem that falls into their fantasy. Some brains, beauty, well-read, well-travelled, well-experienced, all that jazz. (What a humble person 🤣) But this is just the tip of the iceberg.

# Reinvent

To get to where I am today, I had to continuously [reinvent](https://lisajytan.com/life/becoming/) myself. I had to set high standards for myself. I had to define life in my own terms. Sometimes it comes with challenges because it does not conform to social standards. But it did not and will not stop me from being who I truly am.

That being said, the dark side of me comes with insanely high expectations and standards. I’m really learning to mitigate that. But why the fuck would I want to settle for anything less than what I want?

I’m not going to apologize for me being me. I am not going to settle for anything less. So naturally, that translates to high stress and pressure of being in a relationship with me. Thankfully I enjoy my solitude, so in the worst case scenario, being alone isn’t the worst thing in the world.

# **About People**

I really enjoy hanging out with people who have their shit together, well-read, well-experienced and have an open mind. It’s not that I’m picky or materialistic, it’s about having the same wave-length to talk about things. 

Anyways, I’m 25 years old. It’s the last day of the 4th month. I’ve spent the entire April socialising, making new friends, networking, having wonderful time. But that is enough. I’m done. It’s taking a toll on me. Time to go back to my hermit shell and focus on my beautiful priority — deep work in token economics.

Here’s to the future baby! ❤️

Love,
