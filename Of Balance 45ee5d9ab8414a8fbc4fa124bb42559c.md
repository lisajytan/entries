Life is all about balancing and rebalance. There are so many things to balance — personal-professional life, social-family-personal time and balancing between internal and external growth. 

# Internal External

How ever I run the company is how I run my life, which is how we deal with clients. Looking from a holistic perspective, from macro systems flow, first principles and then micro interactions and optimisation. It is fun, and I am incredibly in love with my life. That being said, the key is to balance internal and external growth. 

Since being an entrepreneur blurs the line between personal and professional life, many of my internal and external growth for both lives are very similar. Strangely, what is external to my life is internal to the company. It is like a value flow structure: 

> internal Lisa → external Lisa → internal company → external company → internal clients → external clients.
> 

*This makes sense to me.* 

Anyway, one of the balancing act is to balance between external Lisa and internal company. It is to grow my knowledge externally and balance the growth of the company internally. 

# Knowledge and Application

For context, it is to grow externally through using my brain and analytical mind. That translates to the company’s internal growth structure. At the same time, I want to balance between the company’s internal strategy and growth. I see the internal strategy as more of an art than science, when you compare the typical research and analysis done. (Actually, I’m really grateful that [abstract thinking](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-abstract-reasoning-5181522), a new term I’ve learnt recently, comes relatively easily for me. With a bit of basic learning, I can apply abstract thinking very quickly and that really makes life so much easier.) 

The problem is that even if they are part of the value flow, it is a system with intricate feedback loops and I can only work on one flow at a time. It is really challenging to focus on one flow at a time because each action causes a feedback which makes it hard to manage and control. 

So it is a balance between acquiring new knowledge and then applying it. 

## Research and Internal Strategy

This week, my internal Lisa personal goal is to focus on research. There is a thing I’ve been wanting to understand and I want to take time to research and figure it out. The answers are there, we just need the data to paint the story for us. 

At the same time, because of the new corporate strategy, I want to focus on working out the 18 months plan and structure, so I can communicate it to the team and other parties. This already means deprioritising other priorities. 

So to balance between research and the new corporate strategy is quite a tough one. I’m grateful for my wonderful and amazing team to help make this easier. At the same time, it doesn’t negate the pressure, stress and challenge to balance both and be good at all. 

But it’s okay. It will all be alright. We’ve gone through all the challenges so far and we can keep going through them. It never gets easier, but we get stronger. 

I got this. 

Love,
