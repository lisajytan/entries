Upon reflecting for Q3, I realised that I am actively avoiding 1 thing â€” responsibility. More specifically, the greater responsibility of everything that is going on. Beyond just my life, but the extension of the team and all divisions of the company too. Growing fast is great. In it comes new challenges and responsibilities that I learning to manage better. 

One thing Winston Churchill mentioned was 

> the price of greatness is responsibility.

And that helped me to realise the answer to this weakness of mine. I've been focusing so much on the foundations and principles to get to where I am today. And today, the consequences are coming to live. And the consequence is simply **R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y.**

I **know** this is all part of growth. I deliberately and consciously chose this path. I want to do this. I want this hardship. I want to spend years building the foundation. And the natural progression is simply the positive outcome (responsibility) of everything I have built so far. So this just hit me. And this is simply a new information that I will take into my daily expectations. 

But sometimes, to be honest, I just pause and wonder *"Man, can I catch a break?"*. It's a good problem to have, of course. Growing, learning, changing, impacting. But just like how we don't *need* 2% annual GDP growth, we don't *need* this constant insane growth. And I'd like to pause time for a bit just to bask in this current progress. The constant growth can be unnecessarily stressful. 

But, all I need is some time in nature, some time alone, and some time away from work. That is my pause, and I can come back to my work any time. I'm grateful to be absolutely in love with what I do. I'm reaping the harvest now with responsibility. So all's good. 

Take time. Progress at the comfortable pace. Embrace responsibilities as it comes along.
