On very random occasions, I would look at myself/my life and then wonder how on earth did I get to where I am right now. As always, I'm forever thankful and grateful for everyone I've met and especially myself though, for making the right decisions, years in advance.

## Planning in Advance

People always ask me, "what's the point of planning?" I guess nobody ever understands the usefulness of planning until you really do. I would like to think that I'm a planner. As much as I love and enjoy spontaneity, I always plan ahead and take calculated risks. For instance, I would always look ahead and decide what I want then. And I'd make decisions based on those goals of mine.

Steve Jobs said you cannot connect the dots moving forward, only looking back. That's true because I always do things differently from others (because I want different things) and when I look back, I'm so thankful for everything I've done for myself. I am able to enjoy everything at where I am right now, thanks to where I've brought myself to, in the past.

When we talk about my presentation skills, my hard working attitude, my leadership, my networking/small talks ability, etc; it is ALL thanks to the past me, always looking out for the future me! There is probably no such thing has talent if you do not nurture it. Also, talents can also be created. Perhaps I do have a slightly more vocal personality, which makes it easier for me to present, for me to speak in front of lots of people. However, it being easier does not mean I have a flare/talent for speaking. It is though tons of practice, experience and lessons learnt (through failures) that I am who I am today. As for leadership and personal development, I enjoy developing myself because I want to become the best version of me. So, I read consistently, I practice what I preach and I model after successful people. I also throw myself into situations that are uncomfortable and then survive it.

## Out of Comfort Zone

I swear I was the first who preached about going out of your comfort zone because it is there, where you enter the learning zone. Well I guess it stuck with some people and they use it instead but whatever. Intellectual property for ideas and words are not (easily) protected.

Nonetheless, I would always put myself out of my comfort zone for I believe in what I say. I enjoy learning, I enjoy experiencing things and I love being out of my comfort zone. I learn so much more and gain lots of insights. I am lucky to meet people who are always putting my out of my comfort zone. I've learnt so much from that because I realise how much further I can do if I am brave enough!

I also constantly put myself in tough situations. Like going to crappy camps, learning survival skills and doing that I don't think I'd do. And it is through there where I stretched myself fully and mature faster. I also meet more types of people and that just broadens my view in life. I have met with people form the richest of the richest society that you can't fathom the richness, to mid-class and the poorest of the poorest, where they struggle to survive every day. I learn to feel, to empathise and to reflect upon myself every time.

## Reflecting and Me-Time

I constantly reflect, to internalise my own thoughts, actions and desires. I seek to understand myself before being able to help myself and others too. With the help of reflection, I am better able to understand man-kind, which helps me to make better and more informed decisions in the future.

Me-time is also critical and important because it is through that, where I am able to be at peace with myself, to love myself and to actually think about me. It is definitely not a narcissistic thing to do, because after all, the most important relationship you should have is with yourself. If you are able to fully and truly love yourself, will you then be able to shower love on others. It is also about self-acceptance, about empowerment and about planning. Hell yeah, I think about my life all the time during my me-time sessions. Like what I want to do, why I am doing what I am and how else can I change to improve to make myself a better person.

## the People in my Life

Lastly, not forgetting the people in my life. There is no amount of words in the english language that can/will ever be enough for me to express my love, thankfulness and gratitude for everyone in my life. The reason I am where I am today, is also though lots of motivation, experience and connection with the people I have. I always reflect and wonder how on earth am I ALWAYS so lucky to have met the best people that the universe ever has. I am in love with everyone, their existence and I wish I could always hug them everyday.

Some people drain you, some pull you up. This is why as much as I love every single person, I also do have times where I just need to get away from it all, to find peace in solitary. With the ability to move a crowd, to find comfort in being alone; the great vision and plans for the future, yet the mischievous impromptu decisions; the confidence to lead, the humility to serve; the willingness to understand and the will to make radical decisions. I am where I am today because of so many things! I will always be grateful and thankful for everything and everyone.
