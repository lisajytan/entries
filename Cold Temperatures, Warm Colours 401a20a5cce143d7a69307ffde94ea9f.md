The lingering scent

in the air after summer

yet before winter.

A perfect balance

of beauty from summer

and tranquility in winter.

The smell of the wet rain,

cool dry wind dancing

boots stepping in theÂ leaves

Sometimes even,

you get to taste the aftermath

of summer air.

- Lisa T. Cold Temperatures, Warm Colours

There is something about autumn that is so raw and beautiful. It is almost like nature starting anew, yet before its final moments, beautifying the world with a splash of rich warm colours. It is perhaps, nature's way to telling you to find hope in everything. Even at the last breath, the leaves were able to be its own spring, with the many shades of colours.

Like nature, your soul constantly produces an array of colours to inspire and brighten up your world and others. Allow goodness to shine from within and make the world a better place. When you lost hope in everything, learn to be your own spring and carry on. (Autumn is my favorite season)
