> That mountain you've been carrying, you were only suppose to climb
> 

Sometimes, I get really stressed. I get stressed because as an entrepreneur with a team, it means that I have to keep getting clients to make money and pay my team. It gets overwhelming on some months, not going to lie. But things always work out and I'm grateful for that. 

This quote hit me. It allowed me to see my stress as a mountain not to carry, but to climb. Stress is good when used right. Instead of seeing it as a baggage, I see the stress to bring clients in as part of positive pressure to keep growing, keep learning, keep pushing. I can imagine how a fixed salary is as addictive as heroine. Hence, having this stress is actually good and keeps me on my toes. Helps me to keep pushing. 

I'm going to start looking at the world like this. Not a mountain to carry, but a mountain to climb and conquer. 

Let's go!

Love,
