I think not only does one need to be physically pleasant looking, they also have to have an aurora of charm and sexiness, always leaving people to want more. In addition, one needs to know how to dress to complete the physical attractiveness.

Next would be the inside. Intelligence is sexy. I can’t help but be attracted to people who are intelligent. Physical appearance only attracts me that much and I’m usually often turned off by stupidity.

Also, the burning passion of something one believe strongly in. Be it cooking, entrepreneurship, banking or whatever, as long as you live for something, there goes my pants.

Lastly, it’s about personal development. When one constantly seeks to improve him/herself through reading and changing their lifestyle, that’s the whole package of perfection.

I want to be the ultimate definition of perfect I believe in. And I also believe I’m pretty much on my way.
