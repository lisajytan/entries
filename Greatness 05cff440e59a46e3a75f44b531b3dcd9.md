> Surround yourself with the dreamers and the doers, the believers and thinkers, but most of all, surround yourself with those who see the greatness within you, even when you don’t see it yourself. — Edmund Lee

Above all, I’m most thankful to be standing amongst giants and on the shoulders of giants. In the past few years, through the kindness of people who see greatness in me, I’ve been learning and growing exponentially. To be amongst the best of the best is nothing but the most humbling experience.

I believe that you are the average of the 5 people you’re closest with. That means everything from mindset to health to finances to attitudes. Hence, I keep changing the 5 closest people. It’s been a few years now, and I’m glad to seek out the best thinkers and doers there is. They inspire me to be better and to keep striving for excellence.

Life isn’t all rainbows and butterflies. Some days are just shit. Sometimes when in doubt, have faith that the universe will always find a way to you. I’m thankful that the universe sends me random people to remind me of the greatness they see in me; be it a random meeting on the beach, the long-lost close friend that suddenly reconnected or a person that’s always in my life. When the rest of the world continues to see so much greatness in me, it’s easy to regain the faith in what I do again.

Keep going, you’re doing amazing.

Love,
