I have a little secret. It’s a time machine I’ve built. When I have to, I can always ride my time machine and teleport back to a moment.

The time machine I’m talking about are notebooks. I love journaling and writing — in both physical and digital form. I keep little ticket stubs, stickers, museum passes, pebbles, handwoven bracelets, plane tickets, etc. My thoughts and these physical artifacts become my little museum of memories.

Once in a while, I’d go back into my time machine and indulge in the memories. Not to change anything, but to experience them all over again. My happiness, my sorrows, my doubts, my fears. I’ve written them down in my notebooks with pictures of the memories. It’s almost like I’ve built a museum around my life, and can return to the moments any time.

They are more than just moments. They are memories that will always remain. Sometime people change and situation change, but these memories are real and they are stuck in time. Funny thing about time is that when it is endless, nothing is special anymore. You can do anything and everything. With no loss, sacrifice or opportunity cost, it is difficult to appreciate what we have.

Instead, I keep the memories in my little heart. My heart is so filled with homes of people I love, the wonderful memories and all the goodness that happened in my life. The beautiful thing is that this will continue on, as I meet new people and add to my museum of the heart.

And with that, I will always remembered that I am incredibly loved. My heart is so full.

Love,
