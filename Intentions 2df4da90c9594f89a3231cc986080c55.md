Intentions are important. I want to be intentional with how I spend my time and energy. 

2021 is about discomfort and energy management. I want to be intentional with how I approach all things in life. Most entries are written as a reflection piece to connect the dots of what I've done. As I approach this new stage, I want to continue with some forward looking pieces. It changes the style a bit, but it's useful when I reflect in the next period. 

# Plan then Execute

Everything is about planning and then execution. I enjoy planning because I've seen how it has helped me for 12 years now (wow, time flies). Planning is about being intentional with how time will be spent. I plan in chunks and refine them as I go along. Nothing is right or wrong, we just keep adjusting to suit the current situation. 

Planning helps me to be intentional with the time I have on hand. What I want to include in 2021 is to be mindful about my energy too. There, I can be intentional about how my time and energy are divided so I can intentionally work on them. 

# Start Big

Start with the overview in mind. Then work to divide them into manageable chunks. That helps a lot with being 1% closer every day. It also helps a lot when I see myself procrastinating. Instead of fighting it, I mitigate it and shift the task to something intentional. 

# Be Realistic

If I could say something to myself 12 years ago, it would be "be realistic". Don't forget that you enjoy life, you enjoy going out, you enjoy partying, friends are important, quality family time is key, you have your hobbies to have fun with. I want to be intentional about making time and energy for these things too. 

It's easy to get caught up with work, busyness (bad) or whatever bubble we are in. So, intentionally make time for other things, otherwise we can lose track of the other things too easily. 

# 2021 So Far

- Read or reply to texts when on the train
- Delete apps that are time/energy drainers
- Catch myself when I'm in a bad spiral â€” E.g. some YouTube leads to really negative energy that drains your soul. I dislike that.

Love,
