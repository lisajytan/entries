💡 Destroy what destroys you.

</aside>

- Successful people are not gifted. They just work hard, then succeed on purpose.
- “Headstrong!…because that’s how you have to be. If you mentally believe it will happen your body is going to find a way to make it physically happen.” — Greg Plitt
- You gotta do this for you. This is for you. This isn’t about anybody. Live for you. Honour you. Never lose sight of that.
- The most effective way to do it, is to do it — Amelia Earhart
- If you are not obsessed with the life you are living: change it.
- Alice asked the Cheshire Cat, who was sitting in a tree, “What road do I take?” || The cat asked, “Where do you want to go?” || “I don’t know,” Alice answered. || “Then,” said the cat, “it really doesn’t matter, does it?”
- You know you’re on the right track when you become uninterested in looking back.
- Im going to succeed because I’m crazy enough to think I can
- Darling, you’ll be okay.
- Dreams don’t work unless you do.
- I can and I will
- Hey little fighter, soon it will be brighter
- No decision will pay off more than prioritizing your life and giving extreme focus and energy to the things with the highest return.
- The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as why you can’t achieve it.
- Is what you’re living for worth dying for?
- You become what you think about all day long. (Good inputs in the head please. And not about giving head)
- Your future self is watching you right now.
- Are you afraid? Or are you not ready? There is a difference.
- I hated every minute of training, but I said, ‘Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion’. — Muhammad Ali
- Give everything but up
- All things are difficult before they are easy
- Guess what! You! Can! Do! This!
- As soon as you think “maybe I can get up early and just finish it tomorrow” you’ve already lost
- You need to learn how to select your thoughts just the same way you select your clothes every day. This is a power you can cultivate. If you want to control things in your life so bad, work on the mind. That’s the only thing you should be trying to control.
- We either make ourselves miserable or make ourselves strong. The amount of effort is the same.
- Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don’t wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don’t wish for less challenges, wish for more wisdom. The major value in life is not what you get. The major value in life is what you become. Success is not to be pursued; it is to be attracted by the person you become. — Jim Rohn
- No one is you and that is your power. — Dave Grohl
- Great people do things before they’re ready. They do things before they know they can do it. And by doing it, they’re proven right. Because, I think there’s something inside of you—and inside of all of us—when we see something and we think, ‘I think I can do it, I think I can do it. But I’m afraid to.’ Bridging that gap, doing what you’re afraid of, getting out of your comfort zone, taking risks like that—THAT is what life is. And I think you might be really good. You might find out something about yourself that’s special. And if you’re not good, who cares? You tried something. Now you know something about yourself. Now you know. A mystery is solved. So, I think you should just give it a try. Just inch yourself out of that back line. Step into life. Courage. Risks. Yes. Go. Now. — Amy Poehler
- Don’t settle for mediocrity when you were created for greatness. Know who you are.
- Make it happen. Shock everyone.
- No one has your experiences, the order of those experiences, your relationships, your perspective, your talents, and your drive. — Mary Karr
- Your mission: Be so busy loving your life that you have no time for hate, regret or fear. — Karen Salmansohn
- Start that work now, before it’s too late. Put your phone on “Do Not Disturb”, forget about your crush, close the tabs of YouTube/Twitter/Tumblr/whatever the fuck, and challenge yourself to get work done. You feel so much better when you achieve a goal, even just a small one. Don’t think about everything else going on. You first. Do your work.
- You’re a fighter. Look at everything you’ve overcome. Don’t give up now. — Olivia Benson
- Those who tell the stories rule society. — Plato
- Wake up every morning and tell yourself that you’re a badass bitch from hell and that no one can fuck with you and then don’t let anybody fuck with you.
- know this: you can start over, each morning. — Tyler Joseph
- You have the strength you need to get through this. — Michael Josephson
- Sometimes you need to remind yourself that you were the one who carried you through the heartache. You are the one who sits with the cold body on the shower floor, and picks it up. You are the one who feeds it, who clothes it, who tucks it into bed, and you should be proud of that. Having the strength to take care of yourself when everyone around you is trying to bleed you dry, that is the strongest thing in the universe.
- Don’t waste sunsets with people who will be gone by sunrise.
- Great things take time. Time will either expose you or reveal you.
- If you ever get discouraged or need motivation, remember that the journey of 1,000 miles started with a single step. The Great Pyramids of Giza was first built with one stone. Great accomplishments take time and real effort. Keep working towards whatever you want in life. Keep taking that step forward. Take it one step at a time and you will get to where you want to go.
- Do things your future self will thank you for
