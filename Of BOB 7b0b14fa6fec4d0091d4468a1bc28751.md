When I figured out what I wanted in life, unless I am the best of the best, it feels completely pointless. Life is really easy. Find something you are interested in, and then be the best of the best (BOB). 

Maybe it’s ambitions — in which I am still figuring out how to codify it and turn it to a science to pass it on. Maybe it’s just YOLO — which is really just a relaxed conditions on certain constrains, but not a qualifier to being BOB. Or simply cause “cause I can”. A little less than YOLO, but more “I do it cause I can”. 

It was always *dream big or dream bigger*. If I can dream of something, why not 100x it and then achieve it. Time is going to pass anyway, so might as well. I see this as a dominant strategy. 

BOB is hard to achieve. I wonder if I will always get there. I doubt I will. But it is the continuous improvement that makes me jump out of bed. 

I’m grateful for the wonderful [giants](https://lisajytan.com/life/giants/) and team coming along with me. I can only be where I am because of the most wonderful set of human beings I have had the pleasure of meeting. 

Here’s to the future. To be the BOB. And may my awesome humans and I live up to being BOB. 

Love,
