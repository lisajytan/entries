One funny thing I noticed is how different weekday Lisa is vs weekend Lisa. 

Weekday Lisa is the rational Lisa that focuses on work, research, no time for bullshit. Weekend Lisa is a lovey cuddley Lisa that's like an irrational kid. Either that or partying too much.  

Either is good nor bad. It's just an observation. 

For a while, I did wonder what it means when it comes to [authenticity](https://lisajytan.com/principles/authenticity/). Then I realised I'm still me, and just a different angle of me. Art is also similar. You have a different experience or different view looking at it from different angles. So eh. I'm still authentic in being me! 

I'm most grateful that people see the various sides of me and are okay with it. I have quite different personalities at different states â€” more structured vs incredibly chilled. And that's always super nice! 

Love,
