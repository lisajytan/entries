**“I don’t know what it means to be crazy,” whispered Veronika. “But I’m not. I’m just a failed suicide.”**

**“Anyone who lives in her own world is crazy. Like schizophrenics, psychopaths, maniacs. I mean people who are different from others.”**

Crazy, the single most interesting word that only means the extreme ends. Either a lunatic in the mental hospital or a genius (Einstein) thinking about something no one has ever though. It's funny because Crazy is does not mean any state of mind, it just means people who are different from others. Yet people are kept away behind bars or ostracized from society until they succeed in someone and is deem to be a genius.

The society is made up of a spectrum of people and what is deemed as "normal" is basically what is the most common thing done in the society. There's no such thing as normal, only what most people do.

I take people calling me crazy as a compliment. Because only those who are crazy enough are able to change the world. I enjoy being different, I live to stand out and I love being weird. Just because you are different and have another perception of things from what society deem is right, does not make it wrong. They call you crazy at first, but when you succeed they call you a genius.

Keep that craziness going. Rule the world with it. Just because you're different only makes you even more special.
