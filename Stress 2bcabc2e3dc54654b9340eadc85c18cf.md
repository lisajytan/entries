I'm feeling the stress lately. It always exists and I think a healthy dose of stress is very beneficial. The past ~2 weeks has been a little more stressful than usual and I finally understood why.

Most grateful for friends and people who are there to brainstorm with me and to support me during the stressful times. I'm really grateful and honoured to be doing what I'm doing, and I'm so happy for that. It's a real privilege. 

# Decision Making

The key lesson learnt is that stress is driven by having a lot of decisions to make. I like to make decisions. It makes me feel empowered because my destiny is in my own hands. Sometimes however, there are too many unknown unknowns to make a decision. And that stresses me out. It's a good problem to have â€” plenty of great paths to choose from. I just have to make a choice. 

More often than now, I choose the hard path, but also the path that I am most excited to take. As much as I want to hedge against myself instead of adding more leverage to my future on Future Lisa, I'm hugely bullish on Future Lisa and I'm doing it. 

I'm just massively fortunate that I can make these hard decisions because I know that my friends and family will be there to be supporting me no matter what. And for that, I'm grateful. 

What would I do without the goodness and kindness the world has to offer? The world is definitely a gazillion times better than what we read on the news. 

It's a beautiful place. I'm glad to be alive and contributing. 

Love,
