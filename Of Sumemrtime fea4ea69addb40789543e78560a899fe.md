2014: Last summer, I enjoyed the best beaches in Asia (Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand).

2015: This summer, I am spoilt with the amazing beauty of the best beaches in Europe (Italy, Greece). Oh dear, the definition of “beautiful beach” has now reached a new level. I wonder where next year will bring me to in summer!

2016: And summer brought me to the craziest party place on earth: Ibiza, Spain. I experienced a new level of beautiful beaches by going natural being one with Mother Nature. Portugal’s summer was also a huge blast. I honestly wonder what 2017’s summer is going to be.

2017: I fell in love and spent summer with bubbles in bubble baths, private beaches, and getting drunk at sunset. Everything is more beautiful when it’s summer and you’re in love.

2018: Coldest summer exploring the cities in England and loch in Scotland. Wet and cold summer, but my heart is warm and full.

2019: Learning to balance work and play during summertime. Meetings in Geneva followed by barbecue at sunset. Conferences in Kuala Lumpur and getting home at 5am to catch the flight at 8am. Last minute flights to Oslo and reunion with my favourite girl.

> Summertime is a strange time. The energy level is different and I feel like a different person. I think I just need to learn how to navigate the energy level throughout summer!

Can’t wait for what next summertime will bring!

Love,
