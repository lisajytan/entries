One focus in 2021 is **discomfort**. I want to be better at being comfortable with discomfort. That includes new heights, new challenges, new necessary evils. Once we get comfortable with discomfort, life is much more fun. 

# Procrastination

Yeah, everyone has a problem with procrastination and the addictive feeling of allowing the dopamine hit you like tsunami waves. That includes browsing memes, watching netflix or meaningless time online. It's a strange comfort — being in the comfort zone and allowing the easy dopamine hit to take place. 

But this is not what 2021 is built for. 

Discomfort is the way to go. And to start, it's procrastination. 

1. Realise procrastination is to delay discomfort. If I'm delaying something, the returns better be pretty damn good. It turns out, procrastination has a negative return effect. I'm not delaying discomfort. I want it now. 
2. That uncomfortable thing to do? The part where my brain says "uh no please". Yeah, brain dumb dumb. Action no dumb dumb. The more uncomfortable my brain feels, the more I want to do it. And that also builds up the brain — it's a muscle after all. So let's do it. 
3. So much work, so little time? List them down. Label the tasks. Label what I am feeling. Understand my discomfort, realise it is what I want, go do it. 

With my [pavlov](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/pavlov/) system in place, discomfort turns out to be easier to manage. So let's get to the element and return to the routines. 

I'm grateful that every year, it's to continue growth of the previous year. But sometimes, I get caught up with the returns of the harvest, I forget to sow the seeds and do the weeding and watering. Now that I have realised it, it's back to work! 

Excited for Q1's growth.

Love,
