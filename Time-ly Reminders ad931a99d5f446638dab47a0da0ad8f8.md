Time is my favourite resource ([1](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/me-time/), [2](https://lisajytan.com/life/time-machine/), [3](https://lisajytan.com/life/measure-time/), [4](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/long/)). I read somewhere in my notes about finite vs infinite. Money is infinite, and you can always create it. But time is the finite resource that we should really prioritise. 

# Reminders

- It is never too late or too soon. It is when it is supposed to be.

Don't worry about time. You are exactly where you need to be. It's been over 10 years now, and you are right where you need to be. I remembered so clearly that I was overcome with the feeling that this improbably place was exactly where I wanted to be, where I should be at this moment. 

- Time, so precious. Make each day count. That’s why it’s limited.

It's [ok](https://lisajytan.com/life/ok/) to be [bad](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/25-lessons/) days. Spend some moments to feel and experience that hour of bad time. Then get over it and move on. We get to start every single moment. Make each count. 

- We all yearn for what we have lost. But sometimes, we forget what we have.

So I'm reminded every day, to be [grateful](https://lisajytan.com/life/thankful/) and [appreciate](https://lisajytan.com/life/high/) the things I have. And for the things I don't, I work hard towards them or I accept those facts. It's very powerful to accept that I don't have a huge wardrobe space, and appreciate each piece of clothing that I have. I need no more. It's exactly what I need. 

- With endless time, nothing is special. With no loss or sacrifice, we can’t appreciate what we have

> [Eternity](https://lisajytan.com/life/eternity/) is boring. It is only because we are mortal, is everything so much more meaningful. I want to live till 120. But I still want to die, at the end of the day.

- Ends are for yesterday, not tomorrows.

The [sun](https://lisajytan.com/life/sunsets/) sets every day. It will always be my favourite thing. It is not the end; it will never be an end. The end only exists in the long-run and by then, we're all dead! So seek constant improvement, and time helps with that. Enjoy the journey, that is all that matters. 

- Don't get too attached to anything.

It's taking me years and years, I'm still learning it. Everything is replaceable. We aim to be irreplaceable, as Coco Chanel once said. But to not get attached to anything, it's important. Time change things — both me and the things itself. Don't get attached. Things are impermanent. Meditation helps. Still, in any case, [authenticity](https://lisajytan.com/principles/authenticity/) should always hold. 

- The worst thing is to still believe that you have lots of time.

This! Again with eternity, that is key. So, I always limit my timeline view. Annual, quarter, periods. It is not to the extent of creating anxiety (lol) but the right amount of healthy pressure to use time wisely. 

- Time is a cleanser of noise.

Above all, time is the best cleanser. Its scalability does wonders to level out noise. And we all know what noise does. It drowns out things that matters. 

So there. Be mindful of time. The only resource we can't reproduce. 

Love,
