2 years ago this time, I decided to heed Elliott's advice and build my own community. 2 years later, I am madly obsessed with my community and I love them so much. What time does to people! 

Little more than 2 years ago, I moved back to Singapore. It was a good reason economically, but not socially. I got really upset and wanted to move out again. Elliott reminded me that I can find and build my own community anywhere â€” physically or digitally. So I spent time looking for my physical community and build my digital community. It paid off. 

Looking back, I'm so glad that I made friends with all these people along the way. They saw where my rocket is heading and find ways to come onboard. And I'm so lucky to have these people in my rocket. We're heading to the moon and beyond. 

I'm really so happy! Tired but happy (mood of this week). And I really love all the people I am working with, partnering with or just have the pleasure of having great discussions with. Maybe being an extrovert helps, but these brilliant minds are so attractive, I can't help but be obsessed! 

Anyway, I'm so lucky that I have my community now. In various fields too. Life is so good. Happy tears and happy smiles. I'm so grateful! I have the best people in the world with me! Together, we can do everything and anything. 

Here's to the future. The one we are building. I'm not changing the future. I'm building it. 

Love,
