Lately, I am reminded of this thing called unearned privilege. I first noticed it in late 2017, and have started to recognise it again this year.

# Unearned Privilege: Being Born

I am very very very lucky to be born into a very privilege environment.

Being Chinese in a Chinese-majority society, born a Singaporean, attending the finest institutions in Singapore, never worrying about financial burdens thanks to scholarships and growing up in a society that views gender equally. *It’s equivalent to being a white college-educated male in the West.*

> Being born this way has already put me way ahead of many other peers in my life.
> 

I never knew that. I never acknowledged that.

Life is relative, isn’t it. My peers in school always had nicer toys, bigger cars, fancier houses, etc. For almost 2 decades of growing up, I can say that I lived a very sheltered life.

I do my best to get out of this comfort zone. Hence I love campings, the wilderness, volunteering, visiting old folks homes, etc. It shows me the other side of the world.

At the same time, I cannot deny my yacht trips, rooftop parties, annual travels, Michelin star meals, vintage cars, fancy brands, etc.

### Realisation

It’s probably around 2012, where I started to realise that life was a little different for some people. In fact, it was in 2007 when I realised divorce is a real thing, not something on US tv shows. *In my entire life up till then, everyone came from a good nuclear family. I never knew anything else existed.*

When it came to education and people in Singapore, it hit me most when I was in university.

- Primary school: one of those Chinese christian schools, where everyone had a good background, excelled academically, yet incredibly humble and nice. We were all the same. It was **an artificial bubble**.
- High school: one of the regular schools, but I was in one of the best classes, and the people I hung out with came from good backgrounds too. We were all the same. It was **another artificial bubble**.
- Pre-college: the best course available at that time, and everyone was incredibly intelligent — academically and socially. We were all very similar and there wasn’t too much diversity. It was **yet another artificial bubble**.
- University: wow, I have never met such a diverse group of people in my life before. Well at the same time, I was barely in uni because I was working on my startup, traveling and working on another startup. The **bubble kinda popped**. I could not understand then. I spend a lot of time asking my professors why are these people like that.

Having lessons with these people and listening to them speak made me realise that “*holy fuck, I cannot relate to these people at all*”. By now, this “un-relatability” did not come from my educational experiences. It came from me traveling the world, living abroad, working for various companies and startups, starting my own businesses, etc.

Honestly, then, I thought they were all losers. In hindsight, I was just fucking lucky and had the **unearned privilege to have all of these experiences** in my pocket. No doubt, most of them came from my hard work like scholarships, academic results, character, etc. Still, I would have never had these experiences, if I had not started out much ahead compared to my peers.

# Most unearned privilege: People

At the same time, though my life so far, I am privileged to meet folks from all walks of life — old people still working at 70+ years old to support themselves, cancer patients, extremely poor people to highly educated professors, multimillionaire business owners and other inspiring professionals. The people I meet are open-minded and knowledgeable in their fields. It allowed the ability to speak candidly, started though-provoking conversations and created new insights.

This is the **privilege that I am most grateful for**, every single day. My parents, my family, my crazy friends-family, my entire support system. I am simply humbled to have the raw privilege to have these people in my life.

## My Forefathers

Nothing in life is free. Where I am today, is though years of struggles from my forefathers. My forefathers had no belongings, had to worry about what to eat for the next meal and struggle to even get the slightest bit of education. And here I am, having the luxury of time and opportunities.

I am who I am today because of my effort (0.1%) and all the combined efforts of my forefathers and parents (99.9%). They worked hard so that I have a roof above my head, meals to eat for the rest of my life and never having to worry about life. I can focus on living.

If this is not standing on the shoulders of giants, I do not know what is.

## Help community. Give back. Make a difference. Do something.

This is definitely an unearned privilege. Because I am born into a specific race in a certain society, it has given me a huge head start in life. The ability to receive many scholarships and to be part of their elite community has given me immense insights to the inequalities of life — the opportunities, the network and community of the best.

Writing an economics research paper with [IPS](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/ips) and understanding from the team in [NYC](https://www.nyc.gov.sg/en) about parenting styles and social mobility really put things into perspective. Scholarship community gave me a huge head start. Being the majority race is a huge bonus. Growing up and receiving education in one of the finest cities is just a cherry on top.

Yet, all these knowledge will only go to waste if one does not harness it. For the longest time, I was genuinely guilty for being born with these unearned privilege. It took years to finally embrace it, and realise the best thing I can do is to use my privilege to help others.

One of my goals in life is to set up a scholarship fund. To fund students who are interested to pursue any field in economics. I am also working to be a role model, so little kids in the future can be inspired to be the best version of themselves. I hope to inspire just one person, to realise that whatever they want to be is possible and within their control.

Still working on it. 1% improvement every day.

Love,
