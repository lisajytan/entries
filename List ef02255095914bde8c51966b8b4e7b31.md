A list of things I need to do. 

- Eat. Even if you have no appetite or too busy to eat. You! Gotta! Eat!!!!!
- Remember how far you’ve come. You can fucking do this.
- Take a break. You need it.
- Breathe. It’s all going to be okay.
- Go out under the sun. Nothing like a healthy dose of vita D
- Feel. It’s all going to be alright.
- Be. Just be. Here right now.
- Stop doing that thing you always do when you feel like this. **(*Pushing everyone away)***

I can’t be arsed seeking to be understood anymore. Maybe some day someone will understand. But till then, it is what it is. And I know that everything is gonna be alright. I know I know I know. I can’t wait to be 3 year wiser. Till then, little baby steps. We’ll get there.

Love,
