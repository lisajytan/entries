Lesson: Quality me-time is very important. 

It's easy to get caught up with growth and a busy life. It's even easier to lose oneself in this process. For the past few months, I've been alternating between work and social life. After all, social life is finally back on track. So my mind switches between these two categories.

I've been so caught up with so many things that I forgot to make time for myself. Realising it, I took a weekend off. Speak to no one, meet no one, just spend time alone to do my things. Well, obviously my things include work stuff (I really fucking love what I do). Then I took myself out on a brunch date, went to the library, went to do some errands, declutter my wardrobe, spent time tanning under the sun. All that and getting work done, that has to be one of the best feelings in the world. 

Such a simple thing to do, yet so easy to forget! I feel recharged again. I have my focus back on track and reflected upon my current state of being. Life's good again, and what a wonderful time to be alive! 

Sharpen the saw. This is what sharpening the saw is.
