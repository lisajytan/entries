Started the week with an email from a friend on miracles. “Miracles are thought to be rare and extraordinary, but they surround us constantly if we are paying attention”. I like that. It brought me back to a waterfall in the mountains in the north of Korea.

I had a free day in 2014, in Seoul. Vale went to Tokyo to meet with Peter. So I decided to do a little day trip. I took a long distance bus and went wherever the bus took me. I ended up in a village surrounded by mountains. It was also near the North Korea borders (not the DMZ) and everyone there looked scary. I was there alone, with a backpack, no internet, can’t speak a word of Korean. But I just wandered around.

It was getting warm, I was feeling pissed. Then I came to this waterfall. The sound of the gushing waterfall brought so much peace to me. Opposite the waterfall was a little nunnery. They spotted me and invited me in. We “spoke” and laughed with body language and they showed me around the place.

And all of a sudden, this quote hit me. *There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.* For a moment, I felt like I was in the theaters, watching me walk through the little house and them offering me food and all. At that moment, I realised life is a miracle. A bunch of random events happened and here I am, feeling so safe beside these nuns. It’s a miracle.

Since then, I decided to view life as a miracle. The people I meet, the love I’ve received, the love I pour into people, the opportunities along the way, the pure wonder of coincidences. Everything in life is a miracle. *That is perhaps how I am keeping up with the positivity in the cynical world.* 

Viewing life as a miracle changed many of my perspectives. No one is entitled to any great things, and every great thing that comes my way is just a miracle. To have found what I know love is, to have given and received that love many times and to be doing everything that I love is nothing but miracles happening on a daily basis.

I believe hugely in the effort of an individual. You can’t get anywhere without adding personal effort into it. At the same time, constantly believe in miracles. It’s not “I woke up and became the richest person in the world” type of miracle, but the “I can’t believe the universe lined up and I get to meet such wonderful souls” type of miracle. Some things are too out of human’s control. And I’m grateful for the presence of miracles.

Now, when life goes too fast, I’d take a step back to bask in the wonder of miracles and the little things. Just like how a butterfly flap its wings and changed the world, I embrace the presence of miracles and the wonders it brings.

Love,
