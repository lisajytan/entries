I am immensely blessed to have met all these different people from my life. People from all walks of life, interesting industries, different passions, diverse background. Everyday, I just find myself learning more and more, and sometimes I forget to be thankful for everything.

# All Walks of Life

I am so blessed to know people from seriously all kind of background. From those who struggle to get by each day to those insanely rich, I realised how important it is to be surrounding by different people.

Every time I talk to different people, I gain new insights, learn new things and remember a lot more. Most of my lessons are learnt through reflections and realisation. Steve Jobs said it right, you don't connect the dots looking forward, only looking back.

Everyday I connect more dots, I link more things, I gain even more insights. I just feel so blessed and amazing that I am alive, that I am experiencing such amazing and wonderful things. I am blessed. It gives me more depth in my character, new perspectives in my thoughts and more importantly, I have a clearer view of what I want.

# Thank You, I Love You

I want to scream and shout to everyone and tell them thank you. Thank you for allowing me to meet you. Thank you for telling me a bit about you. Thank you for inspiring and teaching me in all the different methods and ways possible. Thank you for the experience. Thank you for allowing me to learn. Thank you for everything.

I really love every single soul I have met. I learn so much from different people, understand more about life, got things figured out. Life is not a fluffy nice candy floss with rainbow, sunshine and unicorn. Life is a mixture of amazing miracles and hardship. It is a good balance, and I love it.

# Every Day is a Miracle

Einstein once said, “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”

My principle is to live everyday like a miracle. See everything like for the first time. Experience life to the fullest every single time. I love my life, I love every single bit of it.

There are hardship that nobody understands, there are stress issues that I thought I am going insane, there are many moments when I felt like giving up. But the universe works in the most amazing way.

Every single time I feel like giving up, feel so tired, feel like throwing it all away, someone will enter my life and tell me that they see so much in me. Strangers who do not know my story have so much faith in me that it's impossible to lose faith in myself. That's why I believe in the higher power of the universe, just in case someday I lose faith in myself. Because the universe sends people to enter my life and tell me it's all going to be okay.

# The Best Type of Support

The best type of support when you're alone and struggling is for people to believe in me. People always tell me "one day, I will open the papers or magazine and see you on it. I will tell all my friends that I know this girl and be so proud of where you are now". These are the type of support that keeps me going despite it all. I am forever thankful for that.

I'm also living everyday to the fullest and remembering that everything is a miracle. Thank you for all the experiences and insights that everyone has taught me, directly or indirectly. I'm just filled with more goodness, knowledge and wisdom with each passing day. Oh, I am so blessed and lucky.

I wish that you find miracles in your life and live to the fullest everyday. One thing that really helps is to think "what if I die tomorrow. Will I have done my life justice today?"

Love always,L
