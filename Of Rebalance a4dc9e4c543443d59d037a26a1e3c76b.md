Life is a constant re-balancing motion. We will never reach
equilibrium or steady state. We are more like a portfolio that needs
re-balancing all the time.

I truly feel disheartened when I develop a theory that is not what
the norm is, only to learn about the shortfalls and return back to the
norm. It’s like going back to square one with extra steps.

> But that is how we learn. That is how we grow. It is in 
the failures and standing up again, do we find the foundation where we 
lay our bricks upon.

I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to fall and fail and stand up again. And I’m grateful for support like books, resources and people.
It’s not an easy process. It sucks. It’s hard. It’s really challenging.
It causes some doubts. It exposes tons of vulnerabilities. (Saying them
and admitting them feels incredibly good!)

But it is only though this process the [sword](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/over-and-over/) is hardened by the blacksmith. Here’s to becoming a hard sword. Going through fire over and over.

Love,
