> Life is pure adventure and the sooner we realise that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art.- Maya Angelou

Life is a piece of art. It's an art work where you are the artist and with every passing minute, you add tiny strokes to your painting of life. As minutes becomes hours and hours becomes days and days to weeks and years, you are slowly creating a piece of your very own art.

Everyone is an artist. You are the painter, sculptor, writer, director of your life. We often have such great plans "when we grow up", but when is it that you truly grow up? We forget that the stage of "grown up" is happening now and all the actions we take now will determine our future.

When we realise everything we do now determines success in our future, we begin to rethink the choices we make daily. We start to plan well and prioritize because some actions positively benefit our lives while others do not. We have to focus on they key actions we need to take instead.

People tend to wish for a miracle. Yes, miracles do exist but not without you first working towards it. Life favors those who help themselves. If you start crafting your daily tasks towards your goal, as these days then to weeks, months and years, we begin to see our miracles turning to reality. The universe also conspires to help those who are determined and that's when miracles unfold before your eyes.

You are a piece of art and you are the creator of it. Spend some time to think about how you want your art to be at the end of the day. Do what you love and love what you do.

I love travels and adventures. I began to rethink my value and purpose in life. You're the master of your art and you can dictate what your art is. Go on, have fun, create your art piece. I will create my art piece with adventures and stories.
