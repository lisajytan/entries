Sometimes, do you look back and realise that you've changed even when nothing changed from a day-to-day basis? How then, do we maintain authenticity with information bombarding us constantly, fighting for our attention? 

> Authenticity is not a fixed state, but a constantly changing one.

# Only Human

Humans are dynamic. We are not static and we change based on our surroundings and what we expose ourselves to. It's easy to be influenced by the shows, knowledge, content that you are consuming. After all, nothing is ever original; it is a mish-mash of things that occurs and your brain process it.

However, that is not it. You will always be you, without all of these. We can always rely on the principles, personality, values, beliefs. One way to get it back is to reflect and think about why you do what you do and what influenced you to think this way. Delete what you do not like and keep the traits you like. There is nothing wrong about being influenced by the things we consume, it is after all, what life-long learning is about.

## Solution: Take A Break

I take breaks from content once in a while. I rediscovered my love for music again, and it gives me the creative space to allow my mind to rest, before I go into another sprint of knowledge consumption. Take it easy.

The internet, and technology, is only as bad as you use it. Use it wisely, and you're good. Take a break from it, if you think you are losing yourself.

## Solution: Meditate

I also allow time for myself, to just be myself. In a space or state of being. Just being. No phones, no internet, no books, no distractions. Find time to just **be**. In this fast-paced world, we are so caught up doing all the time, we forget to just be. 

Remember to be.
