You can quote me on this:

> With the attitude of an Asian and a mindset of a westerner, one can conquer the world.

One quote I vividly remember when I was little was "Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference". It was a long banner/poster at the top of my school so during afternoon naps, I would stare at it till I fall asleep. I always wondered what it meant, how would I related to it in the future and what difference does it actually make. Fast forwarding 10 years, I found my answer.

## The Attitude of an Asian

For starters, I LOVE, absolutely adore, being an asian. I think that asians have this natural attitude of working hard because they know that hard work, and only hard work can get you somewhere. Talent can probably get you started 3 steps ahead, but only hard work allows you to remain in that "3 steps ahead" position.

As a person who embraces internationalisation and globalisation, I enjoy reading case studies, stories, books and reports about the world. There were so many instances where an Asian succeeded because of hard work. Take the Indian immigrants in Silicon Valley for instance. I have read about so many success stories (and failures too) about how people started from nothing, persevered, put in lots of efforts and they are now millionaires, giving back to their society. There are so many Chinese leaders and great entrepreneurs who made it because of hard work.

This is probably a bad generalisation, but in my opinion, I believe that Asians are naturally more hard working than any other people in the world. Perhaps Asia's rich history is filled with people working hard to become scholars and achieve greatness, maybe also the poverty that drives people to work hard or simply to get out of that cycle. It is a deep culture in our genes to work hard because only then will you/can you succeed.

## The Mindset of a Westerner

I have deep admiration for westerners; of people who view and support equality, the empowerment of women and the open culture to do anything (ethical). I think the westerners are more liberal in their thoughts and mindset. I enjoy such openness for you know no limits. The westerners are willing to risk, dare to fail and then get up again.

What I love most about westerners is their freedom; the freedom to express and the freedom to do. Asians have this traditional background where you have to be careful of the words you use and say because they do not like directness in speech. However, I never have that issue with westerners. I am able to openly and freely express myself and it makes conversation more lively and meaningful.

I enjoy their guts. Their guts to do something different, to be different, to take risks. I would risk it and generalise by saying Asians are more prudent, they prefer a safe route/life (perhaps due to the terrible history that a safe life is a better life) and they are not that much of a risk taker. On the other hand, we hear countless of stories of Westerners failing, getting up and doing it all over again. Again and again and again until they succeed and make it! Then they are brave to conquer the world.

So, the hard working attitude and prudence-nature of an Asian with the mindset of getting up after failing and then conquering the world of the Westerner can definitely win everything.

Disclaimer: yeh I know it's an over-generalisation of the whole Asian and Westerner thing, but I think they're both awesome in their own ways and when you combine all the awesomeness together, you win.
