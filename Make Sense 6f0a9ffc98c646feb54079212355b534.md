> This is weird because sometimes, I forget that I really am creating a company that has a team with active clients and positive cashflow.
> 

Sometimes, it is surreal to realise, remember and acknowledge this fact. I, Lisa, actually am on track to becoming the person I wanted to be when I was young. 

- "International business CEO" of the 6 year old Lisa.
- I live for myself 7-12 year old Lisa.
- Wisdom is only useful when applied 15 year old Lisa.
- Consulting industry of the 15-18 year old Lisa.
- Cross cultural clients of the 17 year old Lisa.
- Economics of the 19 year old Lisa.
- Finance just makes sense 20 year old Lisa.
- Tech is the future 23 year old Lisa.
- A company where I am blessed to work with the best 25 year old Lisa.
- Explore everything that is exciting 27 year old Lisa.

I don't have to go back in time to remind young Lisa of who I'm becoming. I am here today because she worked hard, is discipline and relentlessly strive to become better. She is why I am here today. My actions today are why future Lisa is there tomorrow. 

Lunch with Dan, catching up with Peter, checking in with Wayne and suddenly I realised that I have grown. And things simply make sense. It is like magic. Snap and things make sense. 

# Team

Today, I manage a team of almost 12 people directly under the company. 2 more will be added in the coming month. That is a total of 15 people (including me) under the company. That does not include the other people who are not under the payroll (yet) but collaborating in many forms. This recognition alone blew my mind. 

Just last year this time, I remember struggling quite a bit. For 2 years, I was doing everything on my own. Because that was just how companies started. And when you are in a field that no one cared about then, it's hard to find the right partners. Today, sure things changed. But I will never forget the times where it was all just me. I'm learning to delegate, and still struggling with that. But getting better each day. 

# Business Model

Last week was important to focus on what the company is doing and to streamline the roles. This is arguably the most important "whiteboard session" of Q2. Now, I am also better aligned with what is needed and how to structure the company. Tips and insights from research online now makes sense. I'm just so grateful to be at this stage now. 

I feel like everyday just makes me happy because I'm simply easing in to what I already know and just to be at that right stage. I don't know if this makes sense. I think JJ understand what I mean by this.

## Growth

And that brings me to growth. It is the known unknowns that gives me doubts. But I have decided to ditch that doubt and focus on growth. Because perfection does not exist and solving 80% is good enough. Keep improving on that 20%. That is key. And that is what I am focusing on. 

# Focus

Today, I put on different hats to play different roles in different parts of the company. Thankfully I do enjoy that. Focusing on what matters, and the rest can be thrown away. This is a choice I make actively, every day. Let's go and conquer the world. 

Love,
