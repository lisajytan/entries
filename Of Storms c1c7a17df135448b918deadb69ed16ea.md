> And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about. — Haruki Murakami

The wind is howling. The skies are dark and the window panes banging against their frames. A huge storm is looming in the background. Here begins the stormy season. 

With all storms, the key is survival. I’ve done it before, I’ll do it again. Looking 20 years ahead to look back at these next 3 years, it is the perfect build time. It’s exactly what I wanted and needed. I have anticipated, yet I still feel quite fearful about the storm — a natural fear. 

Storms are nature’s test. A Darwinian test of the fittest and most adaptable. I’ve been preparing for such events all the time so it’s time to test those preparation. I’m excited; and we’ll be fine. 

And the end of the 3 years, we’ll emerge strong and fit. We’ll definitely survive and I’m excited to see who we become at the end of this. A lot closer to where I want us to be — 3 years is a long time to build after all. I’m grateful for my team and who we are becoming. 

I’m also grateful because I have the world’s most amazing man supporting me when I am down. He holds me tight against his chest and kisses my stressful tears away. The storm is only approaching but with him and my team by my side, we’re going to emerge so fine. 

Here’s to the other side. Im excited for this journey! 

Love,

L
