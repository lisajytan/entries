I was listening to a song and it talked about running away. I remembered when I once questioned why I travel so much and if I was unconsciously looking to run away from things. I’m older now with more experiences under my belt so I can say this.

Yes, then, I was probably running away from problems (25%), looking for solutions (45%) and finding myself (30%). 

# Running

What was I running away from? Growing up, I always felt [different](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/different/) and never really belonging in the communities I grew up in. Nothing wrong with that, I just always felt out of place. So when I started to travel, I realised I was connecting more with the people I met while abroad, with open minds and open hearts, curious about the world. 

I started to travel more because I was running away from the mundane static life of Singapore. And also probably from the “path” that was laid out — going to university, finding a job in a big company and working your way up the corporate ladder. If there is a personal hell, that is my personal hell. I actually do fear that, working for someone. 

At a point, I did realise I was intentionally running away and not looking for solutions. Definitely cut back on my trips and focused on solving my problems before having fun. This [principle](https://lisajytan.com/category/principles/) stayed with me till today too, where I solve my problems before enjoyment and drink only when I’m happy. I love my life. 

# Solutions

I was looking for solutions. It was an intentional run to seek solutions elsewhere. The world is a big place, and I’m not spending all my life in Singapore with the community in Singapore. So I started to travel and see what else is out there, looking for my solution. 

No doubt, I had tons and tons of fun. Looking back, I have no idea how I did everything — work, study, travel and have tons of fun. But I guess that is the beauty of growing up and being young. I love it. 

The solutions came in pieces. Like a video game with stages to unlock and more experience/insights on how to play this game called Life. It took me a long time and I am still learning, but my solutions are clear as day. 

# Finding

Have I found myself? A million times yes. In fact, it was never about finding myself. It’s about choosing the path I want and moulding myself towards that goal. And that is a story for another day. 

> Lesson learnt: running away ≠ exploring. Running away doesn’t solve problems.
