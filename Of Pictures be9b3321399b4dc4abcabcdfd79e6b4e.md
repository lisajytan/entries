When any caption is posted, there's usually a vast story behind it. Every picture worth a thousand words because of the experiences, memories, feelings and stories behind it. I summarise those stories into a short line and anchor that memory to it. This is why pictures are important to me; this is why I think about captions all the time.

I'm hella blessed, I tell you. Hella blessed. I am blessed with the best people, the great opportunities and right resources. It's true that you don't need many people in life, you just need the right ones. I'm blessed with the right ones.

I have been blessed with many opportunities in life. Yacht trips, jumping to the middle of the sea, making international friendships and all. I love it because it opens my mind to the limitless horizons beyond and know that everything is possible. But at the same time, because I know that everything is possible, I have become very selective.

With these experiences, I have changed my standards and my expectations. Fun is no longer a simple trip down to a new place to explore. Fun is doing crazy and unexpected things. Travel is not fun unless something happens and you have tons of stupid crazy stories to tell. Friendship is not exciting unless you do dumb things together. Relaxing is no longer just spending a lazy sunday having a HIMYM marathon. Relaxing is a yacht trip out to the sea and enjoying everything you see. Excitement is no longer new toys and new clothes, but reaching new heights unimagined.

Danger excites me as much as it fucking scares me. But I enjoy it. Chilling out is not just a simple cocktail but a drink by the pool under the moonlight.

I do still enjoy the little things in life, no doubt. I enjoy the cool night breeze against my frozen cheeks on a chilly night at a rooftop. I enjoy the simple flavour of home-cooked food when I reach home. I enjoy the little smiles brought to others when you do something good. I enjoy the peace and quiet under the sun on a school day. I enjoy good music for the soul.

I enjoy greater material needs (wants) with experiences but also appreciate the smaller things in life. Take time to reflect and think about what matters and what does not. Your experiences define the expectations of your life. I hope you are happy with your life right now. But if you're not, take some time to think and do some crazy things.
