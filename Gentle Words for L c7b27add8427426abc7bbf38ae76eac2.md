- Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it's the courage to continue that counts.
- Everything is temporary.
- YOU ! ARE ! GOOD ! ENOUGH !
- Know your priorities; and more importantly, know that everyone else has their own priorities too. Don’t take everything so personally.
- Do something instead of killing time, because time is killing you. — Paulo Coelho
- I am trying to see things in perspective. My dog wants a bite of my peanut butter chocolate chip bagel. I know she cannot have this, because chocolate makes dogs very sick. My dog does not understand this. She pouts and wraps herself around my leg like a scarf and purrs and tries to convince me to give her just a tiny bit. When I do not give in, she eventually gives up and lays in the corner, under the piano, drooping and sad. I hope the universe has my best interest in mind like I have my dog’s. When I want something with my whole being, and the universe withholds it from me, I hope the universe thinks to herself: “Silly girl. She thinks this is what she wants, but she does not understand how it will hurt. — THEORIES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE by Blythe Baird
- For what it’s worth: It’s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you find that you’re not, I hope you have the strength to start over. — F. Scott Fitzgerald
- Balance is key. In everything you do. Dance all night long and practice yoga the next day. Drink wine but don’t forget your green juice. Eat chocolate when your heart wants it and kale salad when your body needs it. Wear high heels on Saturday and walk barefoot on Sunday. Go shopping at the mall and then sit down and meditate in your bedroom. Live high and low. Move and stay still. Embrace all sides of who you are and live your authentic truth! Be brave and bold and spontaneous and loud and let that complement your abilities to find silence and patience and modesty and peace. Aim for balance. Make your own rules and don’t let anybody tell you how to live according to theirs. — Rachel Brathen
- Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance. — Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose
- realize it was fun while it lasted and get the fuck on with your life
- Cancel your pity party. Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life.
- So many people feel that they have to wait for certain experiences in order to feel the emotions they desire. For instance, they don’t give themselves permission to feel loved or happy or confident unless a particular set of expectations is met. I’m here to tell you that you can feel any way you choose at any moment in time. — Anthony Robbins, Awaken the Giant Within
- If they don’t know you personally, don’t take it personal. — Khleo Thomas
- Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck. — The Dalai Lama
- I don’t know if I am actually okay or not but I know I will be and it’s okay if I’m not right now.
- You need to have a bad day every once in a while. Otherwise, you’ll never know what a good day feels like.
- Everything you want is coming. Relax and let the universe pick up the timing and the way. You just need to trust that what you want is coming, and watch how fast it comes. — Abraham Hicks
- constantly torn between “if it’s meant to be, it will be” and “if you want it, go get it” -> how about a mix of the two “if its meant to be, its up to me”
- If you’ve ever doubted yourself, walk deep into any forest. Notice how the trees still stand even though they are given no recognition. Walk along any stream. The water still flows, though no one stops to praise it. Watch the stars late at night; they shine without acknowledgment. Humans are just the same. We are made out of the same elements as these beautiful wonders. Always remember your beauty and self worth.
- When thinking about life, remember this: no amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future.
- Why do we even try? When the barriers are so high and the odds are so low—why don’t we just pack it in and go home? It would be so much easier. It’s because in the end, there’s no glory in easy. No one remembers easy. They remember the blood, and the bones, and the long agonizing fight to the top. And that, that is how you become legendary. — Amelia Shepherd, Grey’s Anatomy
- When I was young, I observed that nine out of 10 things I did were failures. So I did 10 times more work. — George Bernard Shaw
- Growing up means being honest. About what you want. What you need. What you feel. Who you are.
- Don’t get attached to moments. Good or bad, they all pass. — Yasmin Mogahed
- Don’t think about what can happen in a month. Don’t think about what can happen in a year. Just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be. — Eric Thomas
- You are so used to your features, you don’t know how beautiful you look to a stranger.
- The less I needed, the better I felt. — Charles Bukowski
- Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a feeling. Now no feeling can be relied on to last in its full intensity, or even to last at all. Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go. — C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity
- No matter the situation, never let your emotions overpower your intelligence. — Jean Houston
