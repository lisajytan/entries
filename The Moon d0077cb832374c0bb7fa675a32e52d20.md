Have you seen the moon?
It's amazingly bright and beautiful today.

There's something about the moon
that always reminds me of home.

It's like if I could blow kisses towards the moon,
the moon will send my love to my homes and beyond.

Because places are not homes;
people are my homes.

â€” Lisa T., The Moon
