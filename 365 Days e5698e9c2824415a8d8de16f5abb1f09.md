A year ago, 
everything was different

I wouldnâ€™t have pictured myself like this

And now  
I look back I have realized 
a year can do a lot to a person

I don't wish to go back and redo everything. Experiencing it once was more than enough. I'm happy to dip back into the memories once in a while. I'm grateful for the lessons learnt, the growth and the progress in the past 365 days. It's been beautiful.
