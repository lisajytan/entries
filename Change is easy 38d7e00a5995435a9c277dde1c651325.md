Wake up

Check in with how I am feeling

Grab my book and cash, head down to the coffee shop opposite my house

Read for 15-20min

Check in with my head to see if it links to anything I’ve learnt and read previously

Head home

Reflect for 5-10min (written)

Start my day

Run with the sunset or workout

Check in with how I’m feeling

Sleep and rest the soul for the day

You know how we always caution ourselves with **change**, because it does not happen a random day, when you wake up and you’ve changed? Well, it happens to me quite often. Some mornings, I wake up and simply **change**. It’s fascinating and I love mornings like these.

This recent change is a new routine. For the longest time, I’ve been wanting to do the whole “get up at 4am” routine. I’ve done the necessary preparation — watched TED talks on it, read about people’s experiences, talked to many people about it. But I never got my ass to wake up at 4am.

Then this week, I did it. Sure, it is not 4am every single day, but it gets better. I wake up between 4.30am-6am, depending on the night I had before. And I’m proud of this new change.

Perhaps the lesson lies in that we only make the change when we **act directly** to the activity, and not indirectly. Nothing speaks about change louder than me making the conscious decision to wake up at 4.30am, actually get out of bed when the alarm rings and bring my ass to the chair to start the day.

It beats the endless hours of passive activity like *thinking *****about doing it, foreseeing the possible obstacles through reading about other people’s experiences, fantasising about waking up at 4am but never going about it.

Think about a business management degree and see any similarities? Many wannapreneurs spend hours *thinking *****and fantasising about the ideal business plan, read about success stories, plan contingencies even before anything happens. Whereas entrepreneurs get their ass to it, learn from mistakes, stand up when they have fallen.

Want something? Get you ass to do it. Stop mopping around thinking about doing it, see all the possible challenges and give up before starting.

Change is easy. The only thing you should be concerned with is where to land on the next step. Baby steps, always.

Love,
