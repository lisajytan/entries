They don't tell you about the girls who fought her own dragons and learnt how to sin.

They only tell you about fairytales

with obedient little princesse and nasty evil queen.

It's almost like they're afraid of acknowledging

a girl can be dangerous and still win.

‚ÅÉ Lisa T; I've been rooting for the Queens.
