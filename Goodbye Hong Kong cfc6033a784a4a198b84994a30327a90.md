9 months of endless fun, time has a way with people. I grew, I learnt, I explored, I loved. Goodbye is the word I never want to learnt in any language cause goodbyes suck and I hate it. But I guess it's time, goodbye it is.

Through the past 9 months, I've certainly changed a lot. I'm not sure for better or worse but I've learnt to love. I found people who became friends and then families here. Hong Kong will always be my second home. As much as it really is killing me to leave, I'm thankful to be back in my home, Singapore, after being away for so long. My family, my friends, my neighborhood, my culture. There are so many things I miss about Singapore, yet at the same time so many things I can't let go in Hong Kong.

## Hong Kong

I came to this land as a stranger; clueless about anything and everything. I will always be thankful for everyone I met and everything I did. If I had to do everything all over again, I'd still go party on wed thu fri and then wake up early to go for hikes on sat and sun. The first few months actually flew by in a blink of an eye. I guess when there's always fun-packed weekends, you never quite notice how fast time flies. As much as I wanted to stay in touch with my dearest friends from Singapore, it was tough to manage that with all the new friends I made and people I met. I was in-awe every weekend and happiness was my only emotion.

One thing I learnt is that even beautiful things have an expiry date. As much as I had so much fun and joy, this happiness did not last forever; of course. December came and one of the people I love left. This stupid Samuel missed his own farewell dinner and missed my dinner with him. I'm still angry at him. And he still owes me presents from all the countries he visited! I'm forever grateful to have met that guy; my life changed because of him. Really changed. He inspires me to travel and explore; meet people and set out of the comfort zone. His yolo-ness attitude had somehow found it's way into me. Hope Australia is treating him well!

Then came the farewell that almost couldn't make the flight. I found a family in Hong Kong and we were stuck to each other for almost 3 months, meeting about 4-5 times a week. I could never imagine I found so many like-minded people, all from different background and nationalities in one city. One crazy event after another, it's the people whom you do stupid things with that you love the most. From 2 attached to everyone being attached, we have grown even tighter as a family ;) When you have 3 months of fun-packed weekends AND WEEKDAYS that's filled with pure love and craziness, it's definitely hard to say goodbye. We almost couldn't make it to the airport on time for the flight but thankfully managed to. Perhaps it was that rush that made the goodbye hugs at the airport fast and quick. It didn't hurt that much. It was after, that felt weird. Someone that belongs my heart was gone, missing in a land far away. We used to walk the streets of wanchai home together cause it was nearby, but then it became a walk alone.

Then, I became thinking and planning my farewell. I didn't want any sadness or send-offs. I didn't want tears or heartbreaks. I just want to leave the country alone and without anything attached. Yet I want to say goodbye to my love ones for the last time. A kiss, a hug, anything that I can do for the last time; anything that can delay that last kiss and last hug. I guess you never have your cake and eat it. I want my family yet I want that family too. If only Germany, Singapore and Hong Kong is like central, admiralty and wanchai.

10 weeks countdown, darling friends came and left Hong Kong, girlfriends night, camping, Korea, 4 weeks left. The sudden though of time flying by fast kept hitting me hard on random moment and times. There are so many moments where I wished I had a remote control to pause or at least slow time down. To recreate that memory, so extend time to live in that moment or just to be so absorbed in the moment. I also learnt that time is equal for everyone, yet it is relative to each. Time with Valentin seems to fly past without blinking an eye, yet time without him never been slower.

Time made me think about the book: The Timekeeper. I love this book. It is inspirational and touching. God limit one's day, to make each precious. Ever since I finished the book, I swore to keep each day precious. I think that resulted in many lazy days cause days where I can just hug Valentin in bed with a movie (especially on a rainy day) is just the most precious things on earth.

I guess like what they say, nothing you love lasts forever. Nothing lasts forever. Everything will past; this too shall pass. Time will tell; time will heal all wounds. Well, all I can say is you should never fall in love. Cause it is a beautiful tragedy.

## Singapore

Roti Prata, chicken rice, bachomee, carrot cake, Penang laksa; there's so many local food I crave so badly. I always thought I could be the independent girl who can just leave the country without beating an eye but it turns out in the girl who comes back in probably tears and lots of joy. After all, I spent 2 decades in this country. And I spent way longer than I expected to, leaving me unprepared for not being in Singapore for a long time.

Traveling also made me appreciate my home country even more. I realise I don't know much about Singapore. I don't even know how big it was! It's 50km (N-S) by 26km (E-W). Populated by about 6m people, we are a city without a very long history. The oldest things that exist are probably 40 year old buildings and an old village in buangkok. I can't wait to explore Singapore, going to places that's not just in my neighborhood and finding all the secret good places that's yet to be uncovered.

But most importantly, Singapore is where my family and friends are at. After all this away from home time, it's always good to have a home to return to. I'm glad to be home ❤️
