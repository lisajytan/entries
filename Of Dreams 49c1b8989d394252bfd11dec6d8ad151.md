> All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible. **T. E. Lawrence**

This is so validating and it serves as a reminder to how I live my life. Life is and always has been so beautiful in its own right, its own presence, its own being. And I'm fortunate enough to live my dreams. 

# Reality > Dreams

I sleep because I need to and I am tired. At the same time, when I am not tired, I can barely sleep. Because being awake is so much more fun than sleeping and dreaming. 

Being awake and making each baby step towards my dreams is just the most incredible experience ever. So what if this is a simulation, or fake, or unreal. Reality is whatever I deem it to be. 

And right now, I'm awake, making each baby step towards building that dream. A future where I can shape. My heart is so full. I'm so grateful. 

Sometimes I am afraid. Afraid that none of this is real and I'll wake up and be 5 years old, trying to eat a grape. But it's okay. It's okay because no matter what, this is real. And these are wonderful lessons to take on with me and redo everything. I've done it once, I can do it again. 

Here's to reality. May it always be better than dreams. 

Love,
