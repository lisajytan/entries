How do I live my life? How did I decide to specialise in my field? Why do I seem to know so little about so many things? This is one principle in life â€” the Big T.

I came across the Big T by one of my professors in university and realised that I have been applying it anyway. He just formalised my methodology and it's amazing. 

# What's The Big T?

Look at the letter T. It shows the shape in which one should hone one's skillsets. Learn everything you can like - and specialise in 1 specific skillset like I. 

It's that simple! 

## My Big T

My Big T is to be both a generalist and specialist. Following the research by Lazear ([2004](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.492.3451&rep=rep1&type=pdf), [2005](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.4785&rep=rep1&type=pdf)), to be a generalist and specialist requires different skillsets and cost to invest in specific skills. It also determines one's probability of becoming a good entrepreneur. 

My broad - includes both making the line longer and thicker. Anything that interests me is added to the thick long broad -. That could be anything and everything random, from Chinese calligraphy art to single malts or financial market to meditation. My - keep getting more exciting as I uncover and learn more about life. 

To define my I, I took a long time to think about it. I have always been a generalist, because it is second nature to me and it is something I do with ease. Yet, I always felt a lacking in my specialisation. I experimented with various specialised skillsets following my -, but they never felt right. Until I figured out about combining economics, policy, human behaviour and technology into one: the economics of tokenisation. Call it whatever you want, but to me, it's everything I have always dreamt of! 

## General x Specialise

This field is everything that I want. It combined general skillsets that I have been honing: corporate governance, governing policies, financial engineering, complex dynamic evolution, behavioural economics, human psychology, emerging technology. Yet, it is specialised in a specific way: virtual digital economies with rules and representation of value in a form. 

You can only imagine my pure happiness when I figured my current from of T. I'm grateful to have figured it out thanks to years of cultivating my interests and passion and being curious to explore the various skillsets. 

Now, I fatten my I with complementary skillsets, while spending the weekends diving into -. 

I live a life I need no longer to dream.
