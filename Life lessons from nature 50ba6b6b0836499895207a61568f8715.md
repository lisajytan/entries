- A caterpillar doesn’t know it will turn into a butterfly. But it continues life with the faith that something good is coming along.
- I realize, there’s something incredibly honest about trees in winter, how they’re experts at letting things go.
- Nothing’s gonna happen unless you do it. Lacy (our lavender plant) had all the resources needed - daily water, organic vegetable fertilizer, lots of English sunshine. But it’s all useless if she doesn’t grow. All the resources are to help her to grow, only if she grows. So that’s what she does — GROW.
- Be more than just a pretty flower. The beautiful thing about Lacy is that she’s beautiful aesthetically - smell, flowers, colours. But she’s also reslient. She doesn’t need daily watering because that’s what lavenders do. They can suffer through harsh climates. they don’t get beaten down. And they just keep growing. Be more than just beautiful on the outside. Show strength from within.
