Were you granted immortality, would you take it? 

I would not. Not a chance. In a weird way, I think the thing that gives life meaning is the thing that ends life itself - death. 

It is only when we truly understand that it is the end, do we get to really experience life in its full glory. With endless time, nothing is special. With no loss or sacrifice, we canâ€™t appreciate what we have. 

I love the fact that we are only on earth for a short amount of time. It makes every moment more precious. The opportunity cost is higher for how I'd spend my precious time. And because of that, each memory is so much sweeter. Life is also so much more meaningful when we can never experience the same moment twice. 

Winter cuddles, spring flowers, summer love and autumn strolls. It is the little things that makes life so much more vibrant, so much more worthy of each passing second. And to be present in the moments is the greatest gift of all. For I can always watch my memories again, just to remember how to feel. 

In a world of sensual pleasures, beautiful people with no histories, mindless consumption and inconsequential actions, I'm good. I love the current reality that I am living in. 

Here's to tomorrow. Another day worth remembering. 

Love,
