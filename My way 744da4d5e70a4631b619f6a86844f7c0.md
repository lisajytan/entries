> Do everything.
> 

We only have 1 life. And in this life, I want to do everything that I want to do, so I die with no regrets. I have zero regrets today, and this will continue to happen. Ultimately, `My Way` by Sinatra is my way of life. 

I really look forward to being old. I'll sit on my rocking chair in front of a beautiful view, telling my great grandkids about my life, my story, my journey. I can't wait to reminisce the good ole times (now) — the struggles, the people, the kindness, the opportunities, the wonders, the beauty of it all. Sure, there will be some difficulties, but I know I will get through them all. 

I live life my way. My own (stupidly high) standards. My own pressure. My own stress. But it is totally fine because I keep me in check. Ultimately, I life my life in my own rules and my own ways. My parents are always complaining that I am too picky and I should settle — job, career, dreams, plans. It took some time but they finally understand where I come from and why I do what I do. It took a while, but they are relentlessly supportive today, even when they don't understand. For that, I am grateful. I don't need the material things. Just the support. Knowing that people I love are there loving me despite the good and bad. I'm most grateful. 

# 120 Years Old

I started Keto + intermittent fasting. Well I had a bit of a cheat moment but it's okay. Some days I eat to little from being busy at work that it is ok to eat after my IF hours. 

Why do I do this? Because I want to live to 120 years old. Be strong and healthy. Still kicking butts then. And the sharpest mind as ever. To do that, I have to start now. Someone asked me a few days ago how old I am. I said close to 30. And that feels weird to hear me saying it. 

Ultimately, I believe the aggregated utility of one's life is generally the same. That is the sum of (all years x happiness per year). Some people optimise for instant happiness and live short lives. We see this commonly for people living unhealthy diets and pass on earlier. Some people are willing to suffer a little and extend the happiness over a longer period of living. 

> I am the latter.

I want to live till 120. That means taking care of myself now. Fasting when necessary. Eating good fats and protein. Removing sugar. Drinking lots of water. Exposing myself to the cold. And soon, supplements with advancement in epigenome research. 

Why 120? 

Because I want to be a teen again. Secondly, I have a lot I want to accomplish. I'm so thrilled to be doing them all. I will need time on my side. The plan is to focus on a specific *thing* every period of my life. And I'm excited for the next many years in life. I want to do everything I can, in my own way. 

# Begin with all I can

Since I want to do everything I like while living on earth, it's important to begin. Starting is easy for me, because I've conditioned myself to do so. I know starting is tough for many, so it's been 12 years of conditional training to make me start. 

The difficult part is the "suffering". The unknown unknowns. The uncertainties. The wanting to outsource help and hire. Yes, that is important. But before anything, we underestimate how much we can do alone. 

So being with everything I can in my power. 

- Unsure about this? Read academic papers.
- How to edit videos? Learn on youtube.
- How to improve? Ask on forums.
- How to be a good leader? Read books.
- How to overcome challenges? Ask friends.

There is so much to learn, so much to know. The [big T](https://lisajytan.com/principles/big-t/) in life is not just for show. It is present in every action and every decision. I believe in first principles and strong foundations. They require time, effort and energy to be built. 

# Find passionate people

One of the luckiest things ever is the people in my life. They are passionate about their lives and what they do. It's just beautiful to see the sparkle in someone's eyes when they talk about their passion. Most of my friends enjoy their work because it truly brings them joy. Money is never a priority because when you love what you do, it is all going just fine. 

I'm also lucky to have passionate people in my company. They also help me to see from other perspectives in their domains and really enjoy listening to them too. Passionate people is necessary for the survival of humanity. It is simply wonderful and my heart is just so full. 

They are my guiding light. I learn so much from passionate people. Them living their way is how I also curate my way of life. Not only that, the dead has also left lessons in books. I can feel their presence in the books and that is just so lovely. 

# Stay on the path

The good thing about my way and doing all I want in life is that I have the freedom. But the problem now lies in the general distractions the world has. So it's really important to stay on the right path and not be swayed by the next shiny thing. 

It's easy to say this. But in reality, it is hard. Because in my way of life, the path is not a concrete paved road sponsored by tax payer's money in a beautiful landscape. It is a hike in the rugged mountains of Patagonia, with overgrown weeds, dangerous animals and a real uphill battle. You never know what path is the right path. You navigate through, test and observe other people's paths. You will find yours, and when you do, stick to it. 

The ending scenery will be absolutely worth it. Nothing is sweeter than that. After 1 mountain, off to the next mountain we go! 

# Hire experts

Lastly, once we have done everything we can, we found people and we found the path, it is to hire people. Hire the right people to continue on the path together. They might be good at finding paths, they have done this before, they are good at camping, they are good at survival. Either way, experts are necessary in my way of life, because all specialisations together can be a huge significant difference. 

Experts help to grow the pie together. And there is necessary in my way of life. Harvest reaped is only real when enjoyed and share with everyone. 

Baby steps towards this every day. I'm grateful. 

Love,
