> I'm so obsessed with what I do. I'm completely in love with it and every single day, I'm just immensely grateful to be doing what I do.

Every day, I'm grateful to do what I do. Sure, it isn't all rainbows and butterflies every day. Some days are better than the others. However, I'm still so grateful to be doing what I truly love. To be researching, to be sharing, to be educating and to be designing and building really cool products. What a joy, to be working on things you love! 

> I fucking love what I do!
> 

It's been a while since I've loved a thing this much. It really is a true blessing. 

Thank you universe, for allowing me the opportunity to explore what I love. It took maybe 10 years to finally figure it out. And I never ever looked back. 

A joy indeed. 

Love,
