The difference between expectations and reality can often be disappointing. And sometimes, that brings along annoyance and anger. 

I felt disappointment lately, and wanted to share how that is being dealt with. 

# Questions to Reflect Upon

When feeling disappointed, I'd take a step back to reflect on the following: 

- Were my [expectations](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/expectations/) too high? (Am I the problem? This is usually the case. It is usually the root cause of all problems)
- Was the situation not what I expected? (Were my original assumptions wrong?)
- Did the other party try?
- Did the other party **KNOW** the expectations?
- Did the other party have the same standards?
- Could I have done anything so the other party could have met the expectation? (Aka communicate)

## Outcome

Personally, I know that I have expectations that are way too high. I have high expectations for myself and I portray that on others â€” because I would do the best for them and expect the same. 

Unfortunately, in real life, it does not work like that. And it is often disappointing and I get hurt. I thought I could build walls around me to not get hurt, but that is discounting the experiences life brings. 

So now, I'm working on communicating my expectations. I can't get mad if I did not communicate. 

And with my expectations? I am not going to change that. There are people who are aligned with me, and I'm most grateful for them. 

The rest? They either rise up to my communicated expectations, or be out of my life. 7 billion people in this world. I know I can find *my people* everywhere in the world. 

Love,
