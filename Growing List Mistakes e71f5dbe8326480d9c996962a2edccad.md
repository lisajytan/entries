You would have thought that after making the same mistakes so many times, I must have learnt them by now. But oh I'm so dumb, I never do learn.

Here's a list of mistakes I've made and I need to stop making them

1. Knowing that my time should be given to my top priorities
2. My time is defined by my own monetary sense so it helps me to think twice when something sounds amazing monetarily but is actually not
3. Procrastination is a sign of being time inconsistent. Short-term enjoyment (procrastination) at long-term suffering (not getting tasks done when it can be done in 2min)
