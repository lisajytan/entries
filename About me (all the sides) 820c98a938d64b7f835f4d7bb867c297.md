- Honestly, my goal is to build a life, and career, where I’m not constantly waiting for the weekend. I don’t want to live that way, where I hate five days of the week because I hate my life and job so much, that the only relief I get is Saturday and Sunday. I want to enjoy my life, and not wish it away every week. I want each day to matter to me, in some way, even some small way. I want to like my life, all of it, not just my life on the weekend.

- And one morning she got out of bed without pressing snooze on her alarm clock six times. She started to breathe. She began to see the world with more beauty than she could possibly imagine. Of all the heartache, of all the goodbyes, and of all the sadness that once swallowed her, she no longer stayed with them. Something changed, and she felt an aura that left her falling deeply with everything. No, she was not in love with a special someone nor was she in love with something as temporary as a new piece of clothing. She was in love with living and that was so important, for now, she can see the magic in her life just by breathing.
