There is the cliche saying of “be careful what you wish for. You might just get it”. I’ve reflected about it a few times, especially during the recent Hard vs Soft Lisa moment and of the chinese curse. 

# Want

At the end of the day, there is a stark difference between *wanting* and *having*. It seems like to many, the state of *wanting* is highly desirable. In this state, people are motivated, driven, inspired. As I speak to many people during our hiring calls and evaluate the reason for economic growth, the having state is a high growth state. 

# Have

As opposed to having. Having is an end in its own right. You get what you wished for. Now, what? Most people are worried about failures that they do not think enough about the next steps after achieving success. What’s next? What do you do after you have achieved your goals? Do the drive, motivation and inspiration dissipate? Or do you anchor those drive towards the next goal? 

# Want, Have, Want

I can imagine the former, because the *wanting* stage is not a piece of cake. It can be challenging and difficult. Whilst finally having had what you wanted, one can take a break. But the reality is that a life that is not growth driven is only constantly lagging behind. And thus the latter of a next goal comes in. 

In the course of growing, learning and reflecting, I observed myself in varying stages of wanting and having. Mini-haves are great milestones worth celebrating, which inspires the next want. Sometimes I wonder what happens when I get my ultimate have. But then I am never worried, for I am curious and excited for the next bigger want. 

So that is it. To want and then have, then want again. When we finish playing the game, we simply just play again. On another ground this time. Better equipped this time. 

I’m excited to never have my wants. But a continuous growth cycle of wants and haves. Like the economy, equilibrium only exists in the long-run. And in the long-run, we are all dead. I’ll collect my ultimate have then. 

Love,
