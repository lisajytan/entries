I’ve always compared departures to sunsets.
Maybe that’s why I find serenity
in watching the bright crazy colors set;
because it reflects my life of endless goodbyes.

But it also reminds me that
endings can be beautiful
instead of tragic.

Sunsets reminded me of those
I’ve said my farewells to,
those bittersweet memories
that make you smile
with a tinge of sadness in your eyes.

– Lisa T, Beautiful Sunsets
