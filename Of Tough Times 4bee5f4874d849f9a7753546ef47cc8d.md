Random moments of reflections made me realise the pivotal moment where I shifted me focus to become me today. And it really was the time when I lived in Vietnam. That was the toughest period of my life — but tough period makes strong people. The toughest part was the fact that my beliefs about life came crushing down. Everything I had made up in my head turned out to be very different in reality — in various forms, which caused me to do a big reflection of my belief system. (Probably a fundamental reason why I got into the web3 space too.) 

Now, 5 years later, I can say that this was such an important experience that I am grateful that I did not miss out. But to get here, it was a struggle. Sure, the struggle was not measured in years, more in months. And my habits and routines helped me to get to where I am today. 

# Perfect Life

The 7 years before those 5 years, I lived a very easy and carefree life. I was living my then-version of a perfect life. I will still relive those days because those were the best days. Travelling, vacationing, making friends, having tons of friends from all walks of life, speaking to people in the startup, SME, large corporation areas, experiencing, experimenting and just having the best time of my life. It was less goal oriented in terms of professional growth, but man was I living my life to the best every single day.

Then in the recent 5 years, I began to define a professional focus and goal, which led me to where I am today. It was and has always been a huge goal. It gets bigger every year, and I am just so excited about it. But to achieve such goals, one has to make sacrifices like being intentional of how one spends time, resources, energy and effort. I had a lot of fun in the recent 5 years, again, living my version of a perfect life Part II. I was in a different space, I had new sets of updated beliefs and new idea of what a perfect life is. It did not deviate too much from my perfect life Part I, but it has evolved in other dimensions. I’m very grateful for that. 

And today, I am in a new place. I can feel the tides changing, the winds altering. I’m very excited for Q3, because I know that in Q4, I will be the perfect balance of the recent 12 years of my life. Q3 will be about change, balance and finding how I define my person life Part III — the Lisa Way. I’m already noticing the changes, and I’m so grateful to have James along this journey with me, teaching and guiding me. Living snippets of my ideal life right now is something I am immensely grateful for. 

Here’s to the future. To tough times and tougher humans. 

Love,
