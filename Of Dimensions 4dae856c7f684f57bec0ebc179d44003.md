> The answer to the universe is me.
> 

Do you ever marvel at the fact that you are you? The more I reflect, the more I look deeper into myself, the more I am constantly surprised at how I manage to become me. There is no one in the world I would trade my life for. With every challenge, I marvel at the fact that I can always overcome them. It's such a beautiful realisation. My heart is full. 

One thing I have been practicing and (hopefully) mastering is the ability to reflect from the various perspectives of vision. First-person, second-person, etc. perspectives. Through this experience, I am able to find solutions in a different state. A new realisation lately is that I can do this on a different dimension, not just various perspectives. The metaverse really unlocked some limiting beliefs and constrains I once had, and opened my vision to thinking beyond the physical constrains. (Funny cause what we do all the time is to remove these limits and it's just beautiful to apply it in my life too. I'm learning so much about self development from running a company. Same principles, different scales.)

When I finally understood time as the other dimension, everything started to make sense. And enhancing that, why stop at 5th or 6th dimension when you literally have no limits? So 12,800 dimensions it is. Why? Because why not. 

So there I was, looking at me from 12,800 dimensions. Suddenly, I understood how I worked. I understood how I am spinning so many plates at once. I can see how I am managing, balancing and progressing. It is a hard job, and girl, you are doing a great job. 

I saw how I worked. I saw how I organised my brain. I understood and reconciled some limiting beliefs, fears and differences internally. An observer in the space and time, I am incredibly impressed. All I am thinking is "whoa how you do that? oh you're me. oh how I do that? whoa I'm cool." I can stay in my head all the time and hang out with 12800 Lisas cause she is so amazing and fun. Everywhere is light, and it gets dark when I sense some fears. Still, I am aware and I'm grateful for these mechanisms. 

And then, I saw the universe. I tested hypothesis and checked the results. Suddenly, I understood how the universe worked. I understood the meaning of life. I knew exactly how to get where I want to go. Oh my heart is so full. Just grateful for everything in life.

I exist on a higher dimension. This physical world is a medium to explain how the universe works. I'm so excited!
