> Plant a tree for your future generation to enjoy. The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago, the next best time is now.

An important first principle of mine is using compounding to leverage the time, energy and effort spent, to get 10x returns over generations. There is no better way than trees doing it. I love trees — they just grow and keep growing. 

I’m reading The Almanack of Naval Ravikant (great guy!) and making notes in the book as I read. Yes, I can just scroll through his twitter, but reading and writing the notes in a book brings me joy. It is also a book I want in my library of my future homes. In one passage, he said “this is hard. That is why I say it takes decades.” And I love it, because decades is the only way I think. 

I want to live to [120](https://lisajytan.com/principles/my-way/) years old, because I can. 

Planing my tree today. Watering it, nurturing it and watching it blossom when the time is right. Patience, my dear one. And leverage the wonder of time. Time, of which compound interest is a proxy of, is the 8th wonder of the world. 

I’m grateful for [time](https://lisajytan.com/principles/timely/). 

Love,
