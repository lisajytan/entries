Everyone asks how I have so much energy. I've been wondering about it too. 

- Perhaps because I'm an extrovert. I get so much energy from being around and with people. Of course, this is a highly curated set of people. I get so much energy from them.
- I'm so pumped about the future. I truly believe that the future can be a better place. And that I can make it slightly better. It makes me jump out of bed!
- People around me. Seriously I do not deserve them. They are the kindest, most beautiful souls that are incredibly [supportive](https://lisajytan.com/life/support/). They're my cheerleaders, my sunshine when it's gloomy, my safe harbour when it's stormy outside. When I need help, the universe aligns people and help me to get to where I want to go.
- And just in general, life is miraculous and wonderful. New cultures, new areas of exploration, old books, old stories untold.

I think I'll never understand people who escape life by getting high on drugs. Because life itself is so wonderful, I'm perpetually high on life. Sure it's a [privilege](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/unearned-privilege/) to be me, and I've been through a bit to get to where I am today. 

One thing that keeps coming back is being [present](https://lisajytan.com/life/present/). It's to begin everyday like a miracle. It's to stand still with time and simply just appreciating the now. We always think that the grass is greener on the other side, but to some people, we ARE the [other side](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/stars-and-planet/). In that case, aren't I already where I would have liked to be? If that is the case since rationally it holds, then I better start appreciating everything I have right now! 

> And thus, I'm just perpetually high on life. High on the now. High on simply being.

Q3 just ended and I welcome Q4 with open arms. It's been truly beautiful and wonderful. Necessary evil Q2 was an important phase and turning point in life. And Q3 was a forward stepping stone. Q4 will be filled with new challenges, new level up, new lessons learnt. I'm both excited and quite fearful, but fearful as a precaution. 

I'm so grateful for the most wonderful people and support system. I appreciate them so much and in my next life, I hope I find these people again and give back 100x. My heart. Oh it's exploding with fullness.

Love,

L
