Days like these when the dark clouds are gone, when the light passes through and the road is illuminated again. I live for days like these. I am grateful for days like these. 

# The Bad Days

Some days, the road is dark, grimy and uncomfortable. Nothing makes sense and it really brings me down. Some days are really horrible. You just want to head to bed and end the day asap. Some days, you just question everything — what's the point of living, why do I do what I do, is there even a purpose of doing what I do? Doubts and fears cloud the mind. 

> And that is okay.

It's okay to have bad days. It's okay to be lost, confused and beaten down. Sunshine all the time makes a desert. Know that bad days don't last for every and good days will come back again. 

# The Good Days

And they will always come back. It's like the sunshine after a cloudy day. It's clear, bright and nice again. I am grateful for days like these. I am grateful to notice and acknowledge days like these. 

It's when things make sense again. I am reminded of my purpose in every step of the day. I know and recognise the value I add. And everything is right where it's suppose to be — a general feeling that I have felt since 2011. I can cry happy tears right now. 

In the past week, I went from being kinda down and unmotivated to being up and kicking butts again! Life doesn't stop for us. The sun keeps rising and the earth keeps spinning. We pick ourselves up and move forward again. 

Of course, this is genuinely not possible without the support of the most amazing people in the world, all over the world. People are genuinely my knife to cut through the dark gloomy skies and bring light in again. My heart is full. 

I found a place with 2 economist/data scientists as housemates. The pool is nice and the room is nice and cosy. For work, I am progressing slowly but surely, focusing on the one tasks at a time. February was a mess because I was going through some things personally and I was focusing on too many things at once professionally. So now, I have learnt from my mistake and making changes to that. 

Baby steps girl. Baby steps and we get there. 

Love,
