I love the feeling airport gives me; the excitement to be reunited, the anticipation of adventures and the start of something new. I can't help but paint a smile on my face as listen to the different accents, the pushing of luggage and the union of different nationalities.

I like to see people reunited. I like to see people run to each other, I like the kissing and the crying. I like the impatience, the stories that the mouth can't tell fast enough, the ears that aren't big enough, the eyes that can't take in all the change. I like the hugging, the smiling, the bringing together, the end of missing someone.

But I learnt that airports can do the exact opposite too. Airports are where I've shed the most tears; the last hug, the last kiss, the last goodbye.
