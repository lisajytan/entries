ðŸ˜Œ Do you ever realize how badly youâ€™re going to miss a moment while youâ€™re living it? Like wow, these are the good days. I am here and I am happy and I feel alive.

</aside>

If there is a phrase that can summarise my life since 2011, this is it.

The evening drinks at the park, bar, one of our homes or the rooftop. The weekend hikes to new mountains. Silly traditions of a mix of cultures, although mainly German. New experiences, new stories, new souls. 

Despite the 10 years of insane fun, I still start my every day with an insane curiosity of how the day unfolds. It's about the little things, the being present, the fact of just being. Some moments when it gets too overwhelming, I take a step back in the moment to capture that present. And keep that snapshot in my heart. It's nothing too major, but it's the little things that makes the most difference. 

One significant moment is hotpot day in Hong Kong. All of us crammed into the tiny little apartment, laughing, eating, playing. Drunk as I was, I took a step back to capture the moment. The pause of laughter, noise, smell, sound, happy faces. It's beautiful. I go back to this snapshot often. Maybe that's why I (used to ) take many pictures when I'm drunk af. 

It isn't party moments in every snapshot. Sometimes it's a quiet moment of me in my corner working under the sunlight, watching the rose bush blossoming in spring. Or the surprise of coming home to a bunch of flowers just because. Maybe just looking to each other's eyes without muttering a word, because the present was all enough. 

How easy it is, to let these moments slip through our fingers. Because upon looking back, they were actually the big things. I'm mindful to enjoy the little things and take time to just be, instead of always do. 

> It's important to find time to just "be" rather than always "do".

I'm so grateful for every single day. For things to be right where it is meant to be. For these memories to be real, whatever real means. 

Love,
