One of the things that keep me incredibly excited about the Web3 space and what I do is that I have the luxury to explore different worlds, different universes, different fields. It is why I started consultancy first too — you get to explore so many things the world has to offer. And to be an expert in many fields, we call them polymaths. 

Saw this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Xss37zYkc) of a polymath who has comprehensive knowledge in physics, computer science and biology. I love that he likes questions that are deep and beautiful. He mentioned how his background is the fundamental laws of nature, of space and time. And with that lens, he saw lots of similar application using the same principles in computer science and biology. I can’t stop smiling throughout the whole video. I feel like I found my favourite physicist. 

The way he approaches life is very similar to how I see the Web3 space — it combines many fields but they are all based on the fundamental laws. What these fundamental laws are is exactly what I’m doing and what my companies are doing. You can increase in complexity, as entropy does to systems, but you can always go back to the first principles. 

I feel heard watching a polymath explain his thought process and how he works. I think everyone over-estimates polymaths. It doesn’t take a genius to be a polymath. One just has to be incredibly [curious](https://lisajytan.com/life/education/) with a level of resourcefulness to figure these questions. Of course, the answers aren’t easy — if they were, we’d have them by now. But that being said, any progress to satisfy the insane curiosity is a step in the right direction always. 

Once you understand first principles from physics, we can apply these constraints and rules to systems that govern us — beyond nature — and how we govern ourselves — through our minds. And once you know what the rules of the game is and how to play the game, you are rewarded with the ability to change the rules of the game and have fun. 

This future is going to be for polymaths. The world is the best playground. Endless imagination, maximum fun. I’m incredibly excited. 

Love,
