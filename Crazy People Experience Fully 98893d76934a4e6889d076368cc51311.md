It’s only when you realise everyday that you’re dying, will you finally decide to live life to its fullest everyday. I love the idea of *crazy*. I love how it means both extreme end of lunatic and genius. It’s perhaps the only word that means both spectrum.

I have a sense of admiration for crazy people. Being crazy is not the same as loss of control. Being crazy is to forsake the society’s definition of “correct”, suppress what you want and live up to the expectations of others. I love how crazy people are so brave, so courageous to follow what they want. They do what they want to do, live their life the way they want and decide on their path. It is a huge pity that society defines people that don’t follow the general norm as weird and crazy. But it is these crazy people that will and have changed the world.

I am reading this book on Veronica Decides to Die. I love it. They talk about crazy in a philosophical sense. In the mental hospital, people are allowed to do anything they want. After all, they are crazy. No rules and regulations of the society will be used to judge them upon. They are free from the chains and ropes of what is the said version of societal’s correctness. People accept themselves as who they are, as who they want to be instead of what others see them as.

The craziest people are the ones that don’t know they are crazy. The saddest people are those that stop themselves from dreaming and doing the craziest things because it is frowned upon. All of such norms are a societal construct and doing something different is just not easily accepted.

Crazy people experience fully. I wouldn’t say I’m crazy, but I wish I am. It’s the crazy people that change the world. They feel to the fullest, the think to the hardest, the allow for me time and self reflection. They internalise what they observe and experience, and turn them into self-realising thoughts. That’s where you learnt.
