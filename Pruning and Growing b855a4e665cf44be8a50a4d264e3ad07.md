> There are pruning seasons in life and there are growing seasons. When I look back on my life, I can tell the greatest growth comes right after you get cut back. — Donald Miller, Scary Close

I need to pause my book to write and journal my thoughts. I'm in happy tears yet again — my heart is full and I'm just so grateful. 

# Current State

I'm reading this book and it shares how interconnected the world is. Nature, systems, electromagnetic fields, universe. Being a scientist, we think linearly with constrains and uncertainty assumptions. But reality is so much bigger than our minds struggle to even begin grasping. But I'm grateful. Despite the scientist mindset, I can appreciate the inner secret language of the universal system as a whole. I don't get it, but I can appreciate it. 

# Like Magic

And sure, there are days where I really doubt my abilities. Thankfully, situations have proven to myself that I am more than I think I am. But more importantly, the magical thing is that the universe just randomly sends people to help when I need it. The people, the talent, the coach, the compassion, the experienced. There are lots to learn, but standing on the shoulders of giants is the best magical thing that happened. 

New parents always ask me how I become me. And they'd like to teach their kids that. I'm heartened by that. But really, a lot of me is through life experiences and interaction with the best people in the world. My heart is full. Diverse perspective and narrative can change the outlook.

# Pruning

Just like autumn, there are pruning seasons. And there are growing seasons. Turns out, they don't occur sequentially but simultaneously. I was pruning and the universe introduced new growth in the newly cleared space. My heart is full. Lots to learn, lots to grow. I'm glad I have supportive infrastructure to keep growing. 5 years. That's what I need. No rush, I am right where I am suppose to be. 

Love,

Ps: I can't rely on these burn-out periods to give me new insights and reexamine my life.
