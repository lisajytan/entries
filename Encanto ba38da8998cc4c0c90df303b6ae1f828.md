**Controversial topic:** I have a worry, for when I am ready to start a family and have kids. 

I’m worried that my future children will become unambitious losers. I place a lot of value in an individual adding value to contribute to the future of society. And if my future children — or anyone close to me — are not aligned with my personal value sets, it becomes incredibly difficult for me to have them in my close personal inner circle. And that sucks, because it’s too late to abort them (lol I’m kidding). 

My close personal inner circle is a set of highly curated people, who are brilliant and incredibly wonderful. I am so grateful to have met these people, and learning so much from them. I live an intentional and intensive life. And those that are unable to keep up will be out of this specific circle. 

Every year, this circle gets more tight knit and connected. This is important to me because the 4% of people that can and will make a difference in the future, is what I care about. Together, we can move mountains. 

Family and future children are by default, in the inner personal circle. I can (and will) have the choice to choose the best candidate for my future husband and father of my kids. I can control that. But for the kids, it is not within my control. Of course, the discussion between nature and nurture is a huge topic that I am fond of and focus on. I do my best in terms of nature and definitely will pick the right lifetime partner. As for nurture, I can build the best environment and provide the best experience for my future kids. But in the end, it is the inner drive of the children to move mountains and shift waves. 

Perhaps I am indeed worrying too much. After all, my brothers turn out fine. It is also a continued process and we can always develop the talents of the children. I want to be very present with my future kids, just like how my parents were there for us. And then hone their skillsets and interests. 

As much as it sounds like strong pressure, I really don’t care what career paths my future children take. I can’t control that. I just hope they become value-adding individual, with an inherent curiosity and a strong yearning passion to make their future a better place. 

I’m actually looking forward to the next stage in life once this current stage is a bit more structured. And I can also focus on my next big project of family and kids. May the gene pool create wonderful children. Totally no pressure on my future kids. 

Love,

Note: okay after watching Encanto, I can see how this is a dangerous thought to have.
