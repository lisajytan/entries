> For the record: No, I do not do cocaine. Never done it. I'm clean and a very good girl!

Everyone keeps asking how do I have so much energy to do the things I do and to keep going. And they usually also wonder if I do coke to keep going. I find that adorable and incredibly sweet. 

No I do not. The real reasons how I have the energy to do what I do are: 

1. I am incredibly obsessed with my life, the things I'm doing and the company I'm building. I genuinely feel so grateful to be able to work on it 6-7 days a week. And 10-12h every day. It truly is a luxury and privilege! Not everyone has the opportunity to do so. I'm lucky to have it. Some days I feel shitty, but those days don't last because the good always outweighs the bad. 
2. I'm truly high on my life. Because the joy of being me and the joy of living my life (including the shitty days!) are just so fun. What a luxury to be experiencing all these things in my life, y'know. There are studious periods (which are fun), fun travel living abroad periods (which is crazy stupid fun) and the now period. The present me is respectfully envious of past Lisa but also super excited for future Lisa. It's a great place to be. (If this is what people feel like when they are on drugs, I get it. I also lucky to have it naturally.) 
3. I'm never alone. I felt different pangs of loneliness because I felt alone in many things I do. Especially 3-4 years ago. But not anymore. I have different friends that I can turn to for help, advice or comfort. There is no one person that is the be all end all. I am that person for me. And I'm grateful to be able to seek solace in other wonderful individuals. 

I have so much energy because I get a lot of energy from working on my ideas and turning them into reality. Life is just amazing. Maybe I am a plant and instead of chlorophyll and photosynthesis, it's energy from people and within and turning that into food sources for me to keep going. 

It just works. There will be other shitty days for sure. Just more water and sun and I'm good to go again :) I also know that this is not a path for everyone. The risks, the discomfort, the uncertainties. I am lucky to be able to do that and overcome those obstacles. I know there are more to come. And I'm more than ready to take them on. 

Life is good. I'm so grateful. My heart is full. And I'm packing the spaceship with my favourite super smart people. We're going to the moon and beyond. It's only up from here on now. 

Love,

L 

Ps: I guess I'm really lucky too because I just have a lot of energy in my life. I guess being an extrovert helps because I get so much insane energy from being and speaking with people. People are the best!
