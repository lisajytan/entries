Sometimes you know when you’re living a moment, and it hits you that it will be known as “the good old days”? The moment started in 2013 when I first moved to Hong Kong, and the “good old days” moments never stopped. It peaked in early 2014, again in summer 2015, the entire 2016, autumn 2017, the entire 2018, and here we are today in 2019. I’m so grateful for the wonderful moments and the kindest souls that went on this journey with me.

And it all started with 20 seconds of courage. Many little 20 seconds. And it changed the trajectory of my life.

“You know, sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.” Benjamin Mee, We Bought A Zoo

I read this quote a while ago in 2012 and it stuck with me for a while. Throughout 2013, there were many “firsts”. First time moving out, first time living abroad, first time learning to meet new people, first time climbing a mountain, first dates, first kiss, tons of firsts. If it hadn’t been for this quote, I am too afraid to think of where will I be today.

Courage is a curious thing. It comes in a split second, like inspiration. But unlike inspirations, you can summon it to appear. Usually when I need courage, I shut everything else down and just do it. As silly as it sounds, it works.

I remember the first time I was jumping on rocks on a cliff by the sea. We were hiking in the southern island in Hong Kong. It was noon, I was wearing one of my favorite t-shirts and running around. Then we hiked up this cliff that was made up of humongous rocks and stones. My friends, who grew up jumping from rocks to rocks, were literally jumping around, where the waves crashed below us. I was fearful, fucking hell I was afraid.

Then the quote came into my head. And I said “fuck it, let’s do it”. I went from crawling on all fours from rock to rock, to standing up straight and jumping from rock to rock. It was the moment where I realised I have grown, I am starting to define the world in the way I see it, and not the protective illusion I grew up with. It was a beautiful moment. Like a caterpillar coming out of her cocoon.

Since then, I had the courage to try new things, to test my limits and challenge my beliefs. And I have never looked back since.

When I need courage, I realise all I need is just 20 seconds. What’s the worst the will go wrong? It’s usually always worth the trade off of thee something great that comes with the courage.

Love,
