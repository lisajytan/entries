> Find your superpower and enjoy it.
> 

Figure your superpower and use it. Enjoy it. Play with it and leverage it to make life better. It is silly how we rarely see heroes using their superpower and playing with it, enjoying it and embracing it. It always has to be used for good — which is a fantastic thing. But remember to indulge and play with it. 

I wrote about my [superpower](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/superpower/) before, and another one I noticed recently is the ability to learn fast. That is a big reason why I can do what I do is because I learn fast. And I forgot to use that for fun. I have been learning for the sake of learning, not for the enjoyment of it. 

Recently, I decided to take every Thursday for research and learning day. I forgot how fun it was to be learning for fun. It’s like being superman and flying around the Manhattan skyscrapers just because. I really enjoy it. 

So find your superpower. And enjoy playing with it. Because what’s the point then, if you are not enjoying your superpower! 

Here’s to Thursdays. No meetings, just me with my books. 

Love,
