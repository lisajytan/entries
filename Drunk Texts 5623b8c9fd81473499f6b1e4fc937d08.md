Drunk texts are precious. 

In that state of intoxication, there’s only specific person you want to speak with. 

In the illusion of pure euphoria, it’s just vulnerability and an open heart. 

Walls fall and the conscious retires. 

The heart speaks. 

The brain pauses. 

That’s rare; that’s precious.

— Lisa T., Drunk
