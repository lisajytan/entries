This is the LISA I know. Honestly, we all have our own shortfalls and issues. And we watch the world judge us like nobody's business. But often, the only person we need to convince is ourselves. There may not be anyone who wish to see eye to eye with what you believe in or what you do. But lisa, never once allow anyone to take away what you believe in. Let the world say what they wanna say. Because all that matters is what you think is right.

I myself do see eye to eye with you in terms of values and of cos some of the things we do. And i will say, you've got the power to control the outcome. You did not built your life on a piece of fluff because what you stand for is something way stronger than that. Your values that govern everything. Thats the strong lady i see.

There is no such thing as a failure, there's only feedback. We grow up knowing from others what we cannot do. But we take it in and work on it. We wont be starting from 0 for sure. But who you currently are is a buildup of all that has happened in your life. Keep your Head up my dear. You're worth every bit of time and effort for someone and you're the rainbow to someone who learns to appreciate you. ❤️🐻🙆
