A beautiful story about the soul of the world and the language of the universe.

I believe that people are part of universe and there's a whole universe in each person. It's a romantic belief I have between people and the universe. It's beautiful to know that the universe conspires to help you. Everything you do is more than a mere luck or coincidence. Your heart speak the language of the universe and understands the soul of the world. It's a beautiful mystery, adventure and romance.

The author wrote in such a beautiful way that I'm completely mesmerised by it. Words of the universe flow like strings of poems. At most times, I teared when reading some chapters, because of the way such intangible belief is described in words.

## About dreams

Everyone of us holds a universe with a destiny to fulfil. Our heart speaks of it, but the fear of failure stops our heart of speaking more. The world, society and other people mould everyone's minds to stop them for realising the powers they have. In the alchemist, the boy met an owner of a crystal shop. He lived his life with what he believes in: to travel to Mecca to pray. However, he forgot about his pursuit after years of ignoring his heart. He feared the consequence of accomplishing his dreams, for he has no other dreams in life. No more mountains to conquer, no more motivation to live another day. He never fulfilled his dream.

What hit me most was this. "Today I understand something I didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don't want anything else in life. But you're forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I'm going to feel worse than I did before you arrived". What a romantic way to put it. It struck me most because I've been wanting to help people around me uncover their potential, to allow them to see the immense possibilities. I forgot to see from their views. Showing them the limitless future and letting them realise the power they hold, it's not exactly the best for all. If one peeks into the plausible future but has no assistance to achieve it, more sorrow is brought after that sneak peek.

## About love

Love is the only common language spoken by people all over the world, animals and plants. It's the language of the universe. The language that the heart understands.

One import at lesson I learnt is that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny. Love is irrational; and sometimes love distort our thoughts about our destiny and fate. Like this boy, how many a times have I considered changing my plans because of love. Love is irrational. Thankfully for me, Valentin was rational. He constantly reminded me that love is just love, but dreams and destiny is something you have to accomplish. He was like my very own omen, telling me things I really needed to hear. Love should never be the reason to stop one for pursuing your dreams. Thanks Valentin for reminded me that. Maybe some day, some time when the universe allows, we will meet somewhere in the world and have another shot.

"One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving". That's right. Love is love. Love is simple. Love is or love is not. There is no such thing as a reason to love. I love you. Why? Because I love you. I don't know what my future holds, but watching HIMYM and reading the Alchemist, I began to believe more in the doing of the universe. The universe conspires to help you achieve whatever you want. Everything is planned by the universe. It's a romantic belief, I'd say. To believe that somewhere out there, you are taken care of. I can't stop tearing especially when the book talks about love. It's such a simple and delicate thing yet it holds such immense power and drive. Like I said,Â *love can change the world.*

Some day, I will come back once again to read this book. Probably it will give me another message. But right now, everything is falling into the right place by the universe. Everything is in line with helping me to succeed. I am excited to the days ahead, and if the universe is willing, may I experience falling in love again as I am on my adventure to fulfil my dreams.
