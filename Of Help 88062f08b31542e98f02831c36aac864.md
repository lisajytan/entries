As much as I want to say that I am "self-made in the making", it is simply just not true. Every day, I marvel at the fact that I have had so much help in my life. 

# Entering the space

I would not be in this space if not for E sharing the potential he sees in me to make a name for myself in this space. He was incredibly encouraging and allowed me to find my own foothold in this space. He continuously supported me when I had massive doubts, and was there when I needed a second eye. It was by luck that I met him. It was not by luck that I entered the space. People are magical. He still supports me and I know he's so proud of where I am and what I'm doing.

And in this space, as much as there was a good amount of work that I had to do, I had a lot of help from friends whom I can ask questions with. I remember the many moments of "interviewing" P and asking him a massive list of questions to clarify my doubts. It was learning at 100x speed, with a google in human form. He answered all my stupid questions and made them incredibly easy to comprehend. He still find ways to help me till this day. What an angel.

My parents kinda get what I do now. But even when they had no clue, they gave me the freedom to try, test and experiment. There was never pressure, but just endless support to let me do what I wanted to do. They assisted with all they can, and cooked great meals and bought me all the food I want. Their silent support even when they don't get it, really fills my heart. 

# Growing

And there were lots of random people and help along the way. There was a temporary gig at a firm to help them with their consulting projects. There was random newsletters that sparked plenty of ideas and concepts. Books, podcasts, non-economics related topics. I was just lucky to be able to see something old from a new perspective and make sense out of it. 

When I entered YouTube and Twitter, people were incredibly supportive. These internet strangers are such wonderful souls. They are so caring and supportive. I guess I don't waste time arguing with people on the internet, so everyone seems extra nice. But still, when some days are shitty, the random nice comments on the content we produce really help me to get back on track. 

There were conferences and meeting people from everywhere. It was great. They are supportive of what I do and just generally encouraging. And then I met Dave, who is now an advisor in the company too. What an angel â€” starting a company is filled with doubts, and he helped me through plenty of them. Like legal issues, like unknown unknowns, like new insights. During the first lockdown, I'm grateful for Dave's weekly chat to keep me sane and focused on work. I could dream big and think so much ahead thanks to the endless support by Dave.

And there's K, of course. The plenty of hugs, support, kisses, safe cuddle space. He listened to me vent, he brainstormed with me, he supported me in everything I do. He's such a wonderful being. Through the silliness and seriousness, he saw me for me and constantly helped me to grow and be better. A call, a text, a plane ride away.

# Developing

Above all, my team. Oh my wonderful lovely team. I feel incredibly lucky to have such wonderful people onboard the same mission. The mission keeps getting bigger, and the team keeps growing. We have complementary skillsets. We have various specialisations. We keep getting better each day. Baby steps. We can do this. 

# Thank You

I'm not there yet. Still growing, still learning. I'm doing my best to learn and grow, while maintaining my sanity. I'm grateful that people are forgiving and patient. 

Every day, I feel so lucky. So lucky, because people are always believing and having faith in me. 

> "One of the most amazing things that can happen is finding someone (so many people!!!) who sees everything you are and wouldn't let you be anything less. They see the potential in you. Endless possibilities. And through their eyes, you start to see yourself the same way as someone who matters. As someone who can make a difference in the world."

Honestly, I am so goddamn lucky. Because people are always supporting and reminding me to kick butts instead of just saying "you're good. just stop". It is only through their support where I find strength to continue. The freedom, bandwidth and opportunities I am given is beyond amazing. My heart is full and I'm grateful. It's hard work, but I am never replacing anything in my life. I'm truly enjoying this chapter. 

Love,
