Once in a while, I check my analytics. *Yes, I want to be more religious about it, but in the midst of so many things going on, I am splitting myself into many priorities. Analytics is just not that high up on the list right now.* 

And today, I saw the YouTube analytics and I'm so happy. My heart is exploding in gratefulness. Because people are subscribing, liking and "turning on the notification bell" for the content created. Oh my. I never expect anything from people who watch my videos, because it's not within my control and people should have their freewill to decide if my content is good and worth subscribing to. 

And when the results show that people **are** indeed subscribing, interacting and appreciating the content, it truly makes me heart incredibly happy and grateful. Oh my heart. 

It's absolutely not about external validation for things I do. I see it as people acknowledging that they learn a bit or two from the content I create. And that truly makes me incredibly thankful. 

Ahhhh. 

I love these people so much. It's weird isn't it. It's like I have adopted these people into my circle of care and they become an online family community. I..... feel like I have a responsibility for these people to make sure they learn and get the best education to make the right decisions moving forward. 

I feel like a mum. LOL 

Anyway, woo. It's a happy day. What a wonderful thing to be grateful for. 

Love,
