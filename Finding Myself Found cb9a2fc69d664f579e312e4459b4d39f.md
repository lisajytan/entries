I'm just reflecting about my life so far, how far I've come and who I am today. I'm super grateful and proud of my progress so far. Quite glad to be able to do what I do and be who I am today. I'm no longer find myself, I've found myself a long time ago. I'm glad to be building my future. 

# Women in my Life. Thank you.

Women in my life are so important. Arguably the most important. Growing up, I'm surrounded by great role models, teaching me independence, self-reliance, resourcefulness and determination. I'm grateful that my mum, grandmothers, grandaunts are all strong and independent. They always manage to take care of the house and their careers. Plus being the eldest, I guess that's how I have the natural tendency to care for people and "take care of the house". It's second nature. 

My girl friends are also so important. They are my rocks and my babies. When I'm sad or down, I know they are a ring away. They are supportive, despite being miles and hours away. I'm most grateful for my girls. The best girls the world can provide! 

But since my nature is still outward looking and wanting to conquer the world, that was not good enough. I found their views a little limiting to truly become the true Lisa I want to be. And that brings me to men, who are so supportive in the other part of me. 

# Men in my Life. Thank you.

One of the important chapters in life is the relationships I've been in. Every men is in the chapter for a reason. I'm grateful for them. V gave me the Hollywood movie love story. E was my guiding light and turned a fairytale into a real love story. K teaches me so much more on the softer things in life and inspires me in various ways. And the various men in between, teaching me and guiding me. 

When I was with V, I found the Lisa who could love and open her heart to vulnerability. Today, I'm more confident with wearing my heart on my sleeve. Without love, the world is meaningless. I'm obsessively in love with work, my life, my friends. Everything is beautiful and I found a reason for being. 

Before I was with E, I knew what I wanted, but I still hadn't seen enough of the world yet, despite living in 3 other countries and being very exposed to the world. I guess it's decision paralysis because everyone comes to you with opportunities and there are so many things one could do. So I was lost, in a good way, I guess. E helped me to gather my strengths together and inspired me to become who I really wanted to be. He was my strength when I could not find any. My safe harbour, my lighthouse, my rock. I'm most grateful for him. He also helped me to question a few of the beliefs I've had that were not useful. 

And now with K, he's my strength when the world is cold, harsh and stressful outside. I know I can always go to into his arm and be safe in his cuddles. I'm still learning to become a better Lisa every day, especially on the softer side of things. He reminds me about the irrationality uncertainty of the world, something the economist mind does not compute. But he is patient, empathetic and just so kind. He reminds me to be a better person. 

All the other men are also so important. Especially those giving me lots of relationship advice, business advice, life advice. I feel like I can only find myself because these people found some parts of themselves and they share those lessons to me. I'm grateful. 

And above all, dad and my bothers. They do spoil me so much, they really do. It's something you don't realise until in recent years, I realise I don't always get the things I want when I ask for them. Because dad and my brothers are not there to make it happen. E.g. wanting to eat something, and dad will find it and buy it for me. ❤️ I guess that's growing up and stop taking these things for granted! 

# Friends and Strangers

Friends are family members you choose. And strangers are people yet to be friends. I'm so grateful for my friends because they are just so supportive in so many ways. Emotional support, validation, business sounding board, someone to rant with, someone to listen, someone to ask a lot of questions to. 

It's not about finding myself in random bAcKpAckiNg aROunD tHE wOrlD, but to find the values that I stand for, who do I want to be, and what I want to do in my life. Then constantly build and rebuild who I am with the help of friends, family, strangers. 

> I'm glad I've found myself. 10+ years of continuous building and rebuilding myself. And it's only just beginning!

Love,
