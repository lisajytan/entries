Dear baby girl,

This will be the best year in your life. You know that. You've waited so many years for it and here is it: 2015. This year, you'll grow even faster, mature more and start many great adventures.

Oh darling, there's so many things in life that you want them all. Baby dear, love is but only one of the many things! It's better to love and lost than to never be loved at all. Even if that might be the only love ever, be happy that you've had it. 8 months of pure happiness, passionate and serious love beats 8 years of boring, non-passionate love. It's good enough.

There are many other things in life to live for and you have to be back on your feet and focus. Your dreams, your future and your legacy. They're so big that sometimes you can't even fathom, but you'll do just fine cause baby dear, you know you will do everything it takes to get everything you want.

## Listen To This

Stop thinking about him. It's not the same anymore. It's never like what it's used to. The past and memories are a good place to visit but oh I caution you, my precious, that it's never a good place to stay for long. You always need to hear these words and since no one will really say it to you, here it is:

> "Darling, he doesn't love you the same way anymore. Hell, maybe he doesn't even love you anymore. Stop thinking about him, stop wondering what's he doing. Stop every emotions. You'll only hurt yourself more, darling. Whatever you feel about him, he definitely doesn't feel the same anymore. Wake up girl, fairy tales don't exist in reality and it's not the same anymore. Let's focus on just loving you instead."
> 

Here it is. Please reread it everything you need it. Please don't be a silly little girl and jump back into that. Stop shedding tears because you've shed too much. You're no longer a little girl, you're the grown up big girl who's turning 21 in 2015! You'll resume your always-glorious self.

Enough about love. If it comes, it comes. This chapter has ended.

# New Adventures

This year, you start your adventures. Your steps towards your legacy. It's not going to be an easy ride, I promise you. But it's definitely going to be worth it. Remember how you used to be? Strong, hardworking, different, independent, persistent, stubborn (in a good way) and filled with passion? These skills are the ones that will help you to succeed. Think of a computer game, and you're equipped with these skills on a mission to success.

You still have these skills deep down inside you. It's part of you, your foundation; it is what makes you, you. You'll never lose them, ever. This year, you hone them, you add more to your basket of skills and you achieve success that you can never imagine. You know you will, can and definitely get what you want because you're stubborn enough to persist for it. You're ambitious, courageous and determined. You'll definitely do it right.

So baby doll, stop thinking about love. It's over. It's 100% over. You know it. Probably there might be a chance again, like after 5 years or something but right now, it's definitely over. Stop mulling over its end. Be happy it even started. But it's over. The end. No more. A past. A memory.

You're a strong and independent woman. You will do all it takes to get where you want because you are Lisa. And Lisa has this power that makes her unique.

2015, the year of success, the year of legacy and the year Lisa reigns in her rightful throne.

Love,L
