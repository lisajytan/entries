Sunsets have been and will always be my favourite thing. Comparing sunrise and sunset, I've learnt to prefer sunsets. Perhaps it is the reflection to my endless bittersweet [goodbyes](https://lisajytan.com/poetry/sunset-secrets/) in life, where I've learnt to appreciate the beauty in endings. 

# Beauty

The beautiful thing about sunsets is that it is beautiful just the way it is. You never look at a sunset thinking, "if the purple hue could increase in saturation on the right. And the orange to have a gradient angle 5º to the right.". Sunsets are simply beautiful the way it is. Many a times, I found myself running towards the sunset, forgetting about the world and just exist in the limbo of the sunset and I. Oh, such beauty in the world. How lucky I am to experience them. 

Like sunsets, so are people with their beauty. I always believe that people are the most beautiful in their rawest forms. You don't need mascara when you have passion in your eyes. You don't need an accent when you have care in your voice. You don't need any plastic surgery when you simply radiate love. 

When I lose my faith in people, I remember the beauty of sunsets. I remember that like sunsets, people are beautiful — just the way they are. 

Sometimes, I do get caught up with the idea of perfection and forget that the rawest form of people are the best. And that some time is now. I forgot about the beauty of people. I'm grateful for sunsets. 

# Daily Brightness

*Pun always intended.* 

Sunsets are the selfless acts of the world. Sunsets exist everyday, whether people see it or not. They do not exist because there is someone out there, taking a picture to validate its beauty. It requires no validation. It cares not about what others think. It simple just is. 

In life, I'm always reminded of being. Being present. Being true. Being authentic. In that way, like the sunset, I exist just because. I need no validation. I care not about what others think. I simply am my own being, doing my own value-adding acts while I exist during my lifetime. 

And in the selfless act, we strive to brighten up each single day. 

## Sunset Life

In the same vein, life should be like sunsets. Leave with a bang. Cover the world with golden hues. Embrace raw beauty. Exist by being. And be driven by one's own desire than the need to seek external validation. 

Make sure life is like sunsets — a sunset that even Van Gogh can't paint. 

Love,
