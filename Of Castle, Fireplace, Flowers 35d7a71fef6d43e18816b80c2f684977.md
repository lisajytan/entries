> Sometimes, the universe just works out. And I’m beyond grateful.

Here I am, sitting in the castle in Chianti, Tuscany. The fireplace has remnants of last night’s burnt firewood, the sky is blue outwith with white clouds and the landscape of vineyards paints the background from the window. It is such a beautiful moment, I’m grateful to be present. 

I wanted to come to the countryside, visit a castle and see the vineyards. I know it is not the season and I don’t want to drive in Italy, but I just thought about how it would be a nice thing to experience during this trip. And suddenly, here I am. In a castle, sitting in front of a fireplace and I have a beautiful bouquet of flowers! I am so grateful, I really am! 

I feel so calm, at peace, and chill. Everything around me is a sense of slowness about appreciating the beauty of the now. It may be 1ºc, but I’m so happy and warm inside. 

This is what life is and should be. The slowness, the calmness, the presence. I’m grateful to be where I am and I’m glad to be able to experience things like this. My heart is full. I’m thankful. 

Love,
