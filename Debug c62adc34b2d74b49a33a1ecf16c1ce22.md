I finally found a problem with me. Life is a constant OS upgrade and debugging sprint session. Scrum style. 

> Debug: yes baby step. Focused baby step. Do 1 thing at a time. Not everything at once.
> 

The problem is that the more I learn and discover life, the more excited I am. It drives me mad! It excites me so much that I can’t sleep! The world is full of endless possibilities and I have nothing but the desire to do them all and be the best of them all. My head hurts from the possibilities, the strength and fearlessness. That is why I keep growing and my OS keeps upgrading. 

BUT! 

But there is a downside. We can’t do [everything](https://lisajytan.com/principles/big-t/) at once. It took me forever to develop the 20 year rule. (I can’t believe I haven’t written about this.) Yet, I am still facing the same problem as before — wanting to do too many things. I see that with my in research, in product design, in services. 

> I need to focus, and narrow down on 1 key core focus. Do the best and then expand outwards.
> 

I see this for PhDs and successful products/companies. They focus on 1 thing and 1 thing only. Do the utmost best and then do the next thing. My 20 year rule is great, but I need to divide it more specifically. 

Thus, commence Operation 20 Debug. 

And I think this is something I fear. I want to do everything but not being able to do them. That will suck so much! Then again, I have many years ahead. So let’s take 1 focused baby step at a time. 

We can and will do everything. What’s the point of living if you don’t do that? Life is too fun. 

Love,
