Dear buddy,

Thanks for always talking to me about university, and reminding me why I even started studying it. Recently, I kept thinking about why economics, fearing that it might be the wrong choice. Perhaps marketing, public relations or journalism would do better as I embark on my Trevellers journey to change the world.

I started economics with the sole reason of "because I like". I really love economics; it explains how the world works. Being a very "big picture" person, I focused on macroeconomics and international economics. It's fun, I like it. Then I got wondering about microeconomics. Like you, I used to think it's pretty much useless. But to keep you excited for economics, I came out with reasons to prove that microeconomics is really important. As a result, I'm convinced too.

If economics tells us how the world works, microeconomics shows us how it works in the smaller individual economies. It's so important because it is linked to everything like behavioral economics, organizational economics and more! It is actually the core of the world - to understand how each small world works. I'm once again really excited for school to start! I can't wait to study and get more knowledge.

Macroeconomics shows us how the world works in general, but microeconomics show how people work. I thought about advertising, pr, branding, writing and those courses, but they will never be as useful as economics. I can learn those other skills while studying (I don't need a degree in that!) and studying microeconomics can help me better understand how things work. God, I'm so excited now!

Thanks buddy ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ you ignite the fire in me again. I've been finding this fire for so long because I've lost it, but now it's burning again! School needs to start ASAP!!

Love,

L
