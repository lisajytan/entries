If there is one thing people say about me, it's how ambitious I am. They find it inspiring and pleasantly surprised. 

I'm blessed and grateful to have the opportunity to find courage and have the right foundations to be ambitious. In a way, it is quite a privilege, because no everyone is able to do that. You can be ambitious, but without the right opportunities, it goes nowhere. Or you can have all the opportunities and resources, but without a sense of purpose via ambitious, it can feel quite empty. 

Ambition is above everything. I hope I never have to compromise my ambition because of love. I've been incredibly blessed to only have people supportive of my ambitions and goals. I never had to choose. Or even if I was young and chose love, they reminded me of what rational Lisa would have chosen instead. What beautiful souls I have in my life. I love them with all my heart. 

Because of that, I'm always focusing on the good. Universe has been kind and I'm always right where I need to be. I'm never alone, there's so many great wonderful people always helping me, reaching out and giving me a lift. Surrounded by giants, what a blessing. 

I guess I never really had to choose between love and my ambitious dreams. Thankfully, rational economist brain knows to choose dreams over love. Ambition is within my internal locus of control, whilst love is not. I choose ambition any day. When my happiness and dreams are within my control, that is where I am the happiest. 

I jump out of bed because reality is better than sleeping. Real life and real world is hard work, but every single day is a day closer to my goals and dreams. 

Thank you ambitions, for existing in my life. 

Love,
