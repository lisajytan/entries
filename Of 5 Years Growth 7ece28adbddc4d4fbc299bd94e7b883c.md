A phrase in a book I was reading prompted me to reflect at where I am today. I live life in 5-year periods (like how the Soviets plan their economic growth ðŸ¤£). 5 years ago, I had a vision of who I'd become. 5 years later, I can say that I am getting there and younger Lisa is proud of who I am becoming. 

# 3 Key Goals

- **When people call, they'd ask "where are you now".** Literally, most of my calls are "where are you". I remember that was something I really wanted, thinking I'd be flying a lot for work. Turns out, I fly less, but everyone is everywhere instead and we speak on zoom. Still, it's a miracle. I love it. I'm so grateful.
- **No introductions about me** because they have heard of me and know what I do. It's less about arrogance, more about "this person truly adds value beyond the superficial marketing that everyone does". I really value integrity and hard work. I'm beyond grateful that it is showing through my work and people are acknowledging it. I still can't believe this is my reality.
- **Inspiring others** and be a source of inspiration. It's one of the things I told myself to achieve before I die. For my life is worthless without being a source of inspiration. And I can say that I'm on my way to achieving this, with all the incredibly kind words people are saying. My heart is so full. It's through hard work and determination that got me here. And sharing the work, not big talks, is inspiring others.

# 5 Years

I can still remember where I was and what I am doing when I had those key goals. Occasionally, I do get [jealous](https://lisajytan.com/life/jealous/) of my past, for what a wonderful life it has been. At the same time, I'm really excited about the future, for how wonderful life is becoming. 

It's important to also reflect, [declutter](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/me-time/) and grow. I've been focusing a lot on internal declutter for years, but have not focused much on the external. *Superficial externality is something I detest.* Yet, I learnt that as one grows, you have to keep the external growth in line with the internal one. Like crabs shedding their external shells for new growth. 

So with a heavy heart, I cleared out a huge bag of clothes that party Lisa loves. I upgraded my wardrobe for a more elegant chic Lisa. I will miss party Lisa, but she has a different type of party now! 

So what will be in 5 years time? Only time will tell. Till then, I'm making baby steps every day to get me closer to where I want to be. 

Love,
