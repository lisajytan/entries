> Life is long if you know how to use it. â€” Seneca.
> 

As much as I'd like to live till 120, I'm fine with living till 90. Not because I'm done living, but because I would have done most of the things I've had wanted to do by then. You see, life is not short if you know how to use it right. Learning about all the great people who have lived like economists, philosophers, physicists or biologists. They didn't need to live 120 years to make a difference. Life is what you make of it. So, I'm ok with that. 

Last week, I wasn't feeling superb. And I realised that's because I am not channelling the energy and time to the right places. I was allowing the situation to dictate how I am using my energy and time, which is very un-Lisa-like, I must admit. There was a problem, I came up with a solution. 

That wednesday, I took time off and spend the first half of the day at home doing laundry and cleaning the house. Then I came to the office to figure a solution out. In the end, it was simple. Ridiculously simple. There's a template online with your life in weeks printed out. 

If I live for 90 years, I am almost 1/3 done with life. That also puts into perspective the amount of time I have left. It is not what I call a lot. So, it helped me to refocus and be intentional about how I will spend my time and energy. 

Since then, I did 2 things: 

1. delete some people and only focus on people that matters 
2. choose 2 things I want to focus on. 1 mainly because it's what I am doing quite okay at, the other is what I am building towards. Everything else does not matter 

And wow, that makes a huge difference! I wake up looking at my timeline. Well, I am not 100% back to my productive state, but I am more conscious about how I want to spend my time. It also helps me to prioritise where I will spend my energy, and that I did. 

Slowly getting back to the good Lisa again. Ebbs and flows. Hardworking and chill a little. It's the convergence and divergence that helps me to be me. So I'm not mad at those distractions, for I have learnt a lot. But now, I want to focus. Yes, those business ideas are good, they are good distractions. They are not the real focus, and we can always go back to them later. For now, I am intentional about where I focus my time and energy. 

Those years were the divergent years. Now, it's the convergence period. Then we diverge again. It's all normal. It's all okay. 

So there. A life doesn't have to be long to be well-lived. If you use it right, we truly have all the abundance we need. And this is how I am living it right. And use this life right!
