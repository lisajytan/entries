Everyone keeps telling me I need to rest more. Every time I speak with Luca, he keeps reminding me to rest and take a break. It's hilarious and I am learning to do more breaks and rests. Honestly, my hobby, other than finance, business, management and economics, is learning about geopolitics. Even if I have all the money and time in the world, I'd still be doing what I do. There is no change. Maybe a nicer home to rest my soul. But that's alright, I don't need it now. 

# Life is Magical

Anyway, life is magical. For the longest time (pretty much all my life), I always had the feeling that I am at the right place where I need to be right now. It was so strong when I was 15. And again when I was 17-20. And when I lived in Hong Kong. Living in Singapore and meeting a bunch of friends. Moving to Netherlands and Vietnam. Tipping point in London. And deciding to move back to Singapore. It's crazy. It is!! Because I had the strangest and strongest feeling that I am exactly where I need to be. 

I'm in love with everything. Life is magical. It's a miracle. I marvel at the beauty of life. Often, I'd take a step back to take in everything at once. because life is **that** beautiful and magical. 

Probably a tipping point to this was when I realised you either see an experience as the first time you'd experience it or last time ever. I think that shifted my perspectives quite a bit. Anyway, here I am. [Obsessed](https://lisajytan.com/life/obsessed/) with life. 

# Everything is Magical

Anyway, the point is that everything is magical. Everything is right exactly where it's supposed to be. Hence, I might be fearful at times, but I also know that the best things take time. So I'm patient. I know that when something does not work out now, it means that it is not the right time now and it will work out when the time is right. 

So back to evidence that everything is magical. Since everyone keeps telling me to rest, well I figured I need to rest more. Went to libby to find a book and guess what! A book called Rest is in there. Elliott has been reading it, so it's the latest book in the stack. That's crazy magical! 

Opened the book and read it. Been reading little bits every other day. Helped me a lot so far and it's been magical. It's not anything *too *****new, but timely reminders. Like, remember to rest and sleep, bc our brain works best then. 

# Brain is Magical

Which brings me to my final point. The brain is magical. It really is. it's beautiful and wonderful. It's crazy magical!

During the day, I get exposed to many things. And it can get [confusing](https://lisajytan.com/lessons/confused/). Which is a good thing, to be honest. We are confused when the brain synapses are trying to make connections with each other. I am both more confused and much clearer my entire life. 

I have faith in my brain. I have faith that the synapses will work themselves out. And that everything will be clearer soon. So I go to sleep confused. And during the night, the brain, like magic, works itself out. It's crazy magical! I'm in love with my brain. 

And the day after, I have the uttermost clarity with the things that happened the day before. It's magical. There is no other reason. What a wonderful time to be alive.

Here's to more breaks, rests and downtime. Then we accelerate forward again! 

Love,
