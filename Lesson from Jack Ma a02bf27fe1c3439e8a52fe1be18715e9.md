Jack Ma is the founder of Alibaba. After the successful launch of IPO in USA in Autumn 2014, this post went viral. Jack Ma shared his views and lessons learnt from his success of Alibaba. To summarise, he shared his idea of Alibaba with 24 friends, of which 23 asked him to kill it. There was only a friend who told him to go ahead and if all things fail, he will be back at where he started. He thought about it and went ahead with his idea. Long story short, Alibaba is now worth $16 billion. Here are his following lessons learnt.

# 1. No matter the success or failure, the experience is a success itself.

I guess you can relate this to Einstein's quote "I did not fail 9999 times, I just found 9999 ways that does not work". Experiences are extremely valuable because it is through all your experiences where you begin to connect the dot as you look back. For one, I can relate this very clearly. My experiences of working with businesses, social enterprises and start ups did not give me any direct successes. However as I work on projects and ideas now, I was able to connect the dot and use my experiences to increase success in subsequent work.

# 2. Be ambitious.

He said ambition helps you to persevere, learn new things and strive for perfection. It defy all odds and create miracles. I agree because with ambition, you're sudden in this realm where everything is possible, you just want to learn and you do all it takes to get all you want. I must say, ambition is one of the best things humans have.

# 3. Desire to be successful.

Have the foresight to see beyond an opportunity. Be brave and chase what you want. Be determined when you set your mind to something.

I agree with this statement. I find importance in people who dares to dream and has ambition in life. Otherwise, life is boring. There is no motivation for success. There is no push for anything. You basically drift from day to day, hoping someone will come along some day to kick you in the ass. But no, life does not work this way. You kick your own ass with that glowing ambition inside.

# 4. No one pities anyone.

We live in an individualistic society where honestly, no one gives a shit about you. In fact, they say when you tell your problem to 10 people, 8 of them don't care and 2 of them are secretly happy you have it. No one cares about what is going on with you, no one really pities you. Thus, I think it is important that you learnt to be independent and chase what you want. Do things for yourself and not for others. Love yourself.

Ambition, courage and loving yourself helps in the success of anything you do today. Love yourself today.
