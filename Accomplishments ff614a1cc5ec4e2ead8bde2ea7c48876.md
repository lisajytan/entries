> Just baby steps every day, a little closer to my goals and dreams.

Firstly, I believe people overestimate me. 

It seems like I am accomplishing so much in so little time. The reality is that everything has been a work-in-progress for years. They just happen to progress and deliver around the same period. There is no secret or magic pill. Just working hard and allowing time to reveal its truth. 

Secondly, it seems like I am productive all the time. 

Also not true. I have my lazy days. In fact, I've started to take weekends off to spend quality time with K and have my mind off work. It is actually really healthy because I miss work again and can't wait to get back into it. It also gives me some space to take a step back and return to the issues on hand. That adds a new perspective or gives me a new state to see the same issue. And I also have my lazy days of not doing anything productive. They always exist. It's about managing and limiting them occurring. 

Thirdly, it is a lot of work done in very little time. 

Sure, it seems like that. But the reason why I can constantly produce weekly videos while building my company and publishing my book is because all the information are in my head. The time consuming aspect is to vomit the information from my head and to do some update to that information. Hence, it seems like it's very little time, but the reality is that the hours put in was done and currently ongoing. We don't see the boring mundane life. We only see the glitz and glamour of success. The boring quiet years exist. And they still do. It's just not being talked about. (And I talk about them here!) 

All in all, this is a space for me to be transparent and authentic in what I do. There is no secret pill. The secret really, is to work fucking hard at what you believe in. Pour all energy into it. Keep going despite doubts and people telling you to move on. And push yourself, even when the world says otherwise. Sure, there is a sprinkle of luck here and there, but work hard. Work fucking hard. That is the secret sauce to everything in life. 

# And how do I do that?

- Routines. So simple yet it makes the biggest difference. Schedule, plan and follow the routine.
- Discipline. That's right. To do the right thing even when no one is looking. To make the right decisions. Stay on the path of the routines.
- Random motivation here and there. Motivation doesn't work. It helps once in a while to start the spark, but to be consistent, it's all about routines and discipline.

Everything else is a whole load of fresh bullshit. You don't need money to get started. Everyone can start now. Right here right now. And if you have a bad day, take a 20min nap and restart the day. 

And if shitty days exist, forgive it. Shitty days will always exist. Move on! Don't get hung up on one lame-ass shitty day.

Ps: everything written is for me. Those are conversations in my head. And sometimes, I need to read them in words, when the voice inside is not being kind. And if anyone benefits from this too, well hello to you. Thanks for stopping by and reading this.
