I have a feeling I know what superhero feel like. Kicking butts in the day and then going home at night. The only difference is that back home, I have the most wonderful support system in the entire world. And my heart is overflowing with gratefulness.

Life is getting more intense and it is exponential. It's a constant balance of learning, deconstructing, reconstructing, rediscovering and cross-pollinating. Apart from the 1920s, this **has** to be one of the best times to be alive.

Yet, I am not going to remain sane if not for my support system. These beautiful souls provide me with the emotional and moral support in the most unimaginable ways. Oh, how do I ever deserve the most wonderful souls the world has ever seen!

# Family

My family always being there. Always and unconditionally. That is what family does right. Sometimes they are annoying, but family is and will always be there for you. Through the good times and bad, when you fuck up or when you're sad. I get to focus on my goals, dreams and aspirations because the rest of life is taken care of by family. They're my giants and they lift me up to new heights.

# Friends = Family

[Friends](https://lisajytan.com/life/overflowing/) are [families](https://lisajytan.com/life/friends-are-family/) that you [choose](https://lisajytan.com/life/crazy-family/). There are different types of friends, but in general, those that I have close to me are basically my family. They make time for me despite their schedule, despite the time difference, despite busy moments. They are simply a call away, a flight away (when borders open), an advice away, a cab ride away.

*I'm guilty of still checking my calendar, but I'm always conscious to block out time blocks for the important people in life. People are my big rocks in my life and I will reschedule the small rocks to put the big rocks in.*

When the day is long, exhausting yet extremely fulfilling, my energy is completely drained by 11pm. Yet, a quick recharge of [cuddles](https://lisajytan.com/love/cuddles/) springs me back to life.

When I'm exposed to new learnings and areas in business, I have the best quality advice, suggestions and resources pouring into my life.

When I'm struggling to fill a gap between my current state and the ideal state, I have outreached hands supporting me to stand up again, helping me fill the gap.

# Support

I'm incredibly lucky and blessed to have the best of the best. Be it moral support, emotional support or always having a bottle of whisky ready for me, it is 100% impossible to do what I do without them.

During the week, I'm working on so many aspects â€” academic research, protocol research, education materials, designing protocol systems, client management, business development, regulations, partnerships and collaborations. It can be quite intense.

It can feel [lonely](https://lisajytan.com/life/hero/) sometimes. But I know when I need anything, everyone is just a call away. I know I'm never alone and I have the best support system when life gets exhausting. A cuddle, a listening ear, anything.

And I'm so grateful that I can do all of these because I know the rest of life is taken care of. I never have to worry about other things. When all I have to do is to focus on my aspirations and shaping the world of tomorrow, life is so exciting despite how physically exhausted I am.

> So everything I have today, everything that I have accomplished, is not mine at all. Without the support system that I have in my entire life, I will never be where I am today.

My heart is full and my happy tears are overflowing. How did I ever get so lucky? I still ask myself every day. The real superheroes are my support system. The mountain that I can lean upon when I'm exhausted. The safe place that I can escape to when I need a break. The [giants](https://lisajytan.com/life/giants/) that lift me up on their shoulders when I'm stuck somewhere.

The most beautiful souls. I love you and in my next life, I hope I find all of you again.

Love,L

Ps: some days, doubt overcast my mind. Yet, my support system has so much faith in me that they chase the blues away. I'm grateful. And above all, I'm grateful that they call me out when I'm bullshit. There is no greater love than constructive criticism because they truly want you to become a better person. My sounding boards. These people are the loves of my life.

My heart is exploding from being so full!
