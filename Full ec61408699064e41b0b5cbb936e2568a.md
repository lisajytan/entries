My heart is so full. It is exploding with happiness and gratefulness. How did I ever get to met these beautiful kind souls that are constantly providing their hands to help me and shoulders to stand on? How did I ever get to lucky? My heart is tearing from gratefulness and happiness. 

It's just absolutely beautiful for people to come into my life and just help me in whatever ways they can. They pick me up, they help me to grow, they help me to pave the way. And time and time again, when I forget and lose track, the universe sends people back to help me get back on the path. 

Oh universe. My heart is full and keeps getting so full every single day with opportunities, hope and faith. Some days, I still doubt myself — although it's a lot less now — that I might not be good enough. And the universe sends the brightest souls to remind me that I am good enough. 

I want to scream and shout right now, because I'm drowning in a sea of gratefulness and bliss. I can cry happy tears right now! 

> People keep asking me, how do I keep up with the smiley face, the happiness, the insane, constant and upbeat energy?

It's really because I have the most beautiful souls in my life, constantly supporting me, helping me and guiding me. It's hard to be sad when you feel like the world has your back. It's hard to frown when life is just so beautiful and gorgeous. It's hard to have no energy when opportunities are everywhere and you know the exact way to get to where you want to go. 

My cheeks are hurting from smiling so much. My body is exhausted while my mind is running on the high of life. Sleeping is hard when reality is better than dreams. 

I'm grateful for meditation, for I am definitely not going to be able to keep up with the insane dose of high from all these happenings. My heart is full. I'm beyond grateful. I don't deserve any of these. I'm so grateful to be this lucky. 

What I am today, is really an accumulation of the most beautiful souls that have been helping and guiding me all the time. My heart is full and I'm nothing without these souls helping me.

Oh my heart. Oh the moon. I'm sending my love to the moon; for the moon will send my love and gratefulness to these most beautiful souls the world has seen. 

I know it's so cliche. It doesn't seem like this is a real life — **my** life. It feels like I'm the main character in a movie or a fairytale. But oh my, is life truly magical. 

It's getting overwhelming again, in a good way. Moments like these, I take a step back and just bask in the beauty of the moment. The moment of being. The now. 

Back in July, I wrote this in my "lessons learnt of the month". 

> Remember when you prayed for the things/life you have now. When I wished for the universe to give me a sign that my skillset is in demand and I'm slowly seeing it coming to fruition. Remember when I prayed for it. I'm excited for the future, when I have it now. And I'm just enjoying the present and working through the steps, proving myself along the way. Remember.
> 

I'm constantly reminded about the things I have now, that I used to pray for. 

My heart. Maybe I'm smiling so much and happy all the time because my heart just can't possibly contain all the happiness, and it's radiating on my face and energy!  

Love, L
