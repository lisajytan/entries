My heart full of smiles

My mind appreciated

My soul understood 

â€” Lisa T, Homesick.

---

I make homes out of people because there is nothing like being with people you love. My heart is full in the presence of my favourite people. I'm so grateful for them. Near or far, digital or physical, my heart aches for them. For I love my homes (people) so much. They are my strength, my support, my cheerleader. I'm most grateful for people.

Thankfully I am still able to visit my parents. And hang out with friends from time to time. Since most of my friends do not live in Singapore, they are slightly less than a ticket away. I miss them so much. May we meet again real soon. 

Love, 

L
