> “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”  Mark Twain

This is one of the many quotes that shaped my life. Twenty years from now, you will regret the things you did not do than the ones you did. Every time I look at a tough decision, I get reminded of this quote. To live fearlessly, to embrace everything you love and to do whatever that makes you happy. That's the purpose of life. That's what gives life a meaning. It's what excites me and keeps me burning.

One exact moment when I recalled this quote was during the hike in [Po Toi Island in Hong Kong](http://www.trevellers.com/the-south-of-hong-kong-po-toi-island/). I stood small between the mountains of large rocks. Below were waves crashing heavily against the rocks. My crazy friends had started jumping (literally jumping) from rocks to rocks when I barely dared to make a step. I was really afraid. I was always asked to "choose the safer route" and "walk on the right path". I never grew up jumping on rocks. I got reminded of this quote and I told myself, "you're going to seize this moment."

It's a silly short moment but then I started jumping too. My friends help my hands on tougher rocks but we made it in the end. The view was astonishing. It was worth every single thing. It was happiness. Happiness is easy.

As I look at my life now, I wonder if I have any regrets. If I were to die tomorrow, what do I have to accomplish today. I've loved hard. I've been thankful. I've scaled new heights. If I were to die tomorrow, I'll write a note to people I love and probably rush out more stories to tell! And then I realise those things that matter to me do not include school. Not education, not cca, not anything. (I'm not saying that I will regret school in 20 years time. In fact, I'll be thankful for school.) It made me think. Education does not define anyone, nor does certifications. Life is not determined by such material items but the memories and experiences. I will live everyday, accomplishing more than I had yesterday, doing things the future me will be thankful for and be happy.

Regret is something not found in my dictionary. Everything can be done, if you want to!
