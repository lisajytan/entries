It makes me truly honoured to say that Economics Design is now 2. I feel like a mum, and my baby is growing. Slowly and steadily. Still 18 more years still we hit that 20 year goal, but every day, we are making the right small little step towards that goal. Compounded, we move a long distance every year. 

# ED

ED started because I saw the power of economics in the space. Just like how you can create your own newtonian physics on your own planet, you get to create your own economics in your ecosystem. These are just governing rules â€” physically or digitally. That blew my mind and I never left the space. 

There were so many (big) decisions made in the past 3 years, because the idea of ED started 3 years ago. And one of them was the decision to start ED. ED exists because of failures. Specifically, no university wanted to take crypto economics and token economics seriously enough as a PhD thesis. It had to be "focus on traditional economics and you can research crypto on your free time". 

I truly believe that token economics is going to be so important. Someone needs to do this research and do it now. And start to define the framework about this newtonian physics of digital ecosystems. 

> Be the change, and ED is the change.
> 

So I decided to start off ED with **R**esearch. Then focusing on **E**ducation and **D**esigning the economics. Hence, the tag is RED. And why most of the colour scheme is red or pink. 

I remember spending entire days reading papers. I read most, if not all, of the papers in my [resource list](http://bit.ly/tokenomics-resources). Only included those useful ones. And read them till the last 1800s. Plenty of brilliant economists then, but there wasn't the right technology nor innovation to allow the ideas to flourish. 

> Today, we have the tools. We have the technology! We can turn these into reality.
> 

So I deconstruct the economics into its core foundational principles. No first principles like Newton's laws, but foundational ones in economics. And build the framework up from there. 

Spoken at conferences, hosted many lectures in London and lots of meetings with the brightest minds. And then consultancy came because people didn't know what to do about the economics. Many just think about token distribution and discounts on first tokens. Well, token economics is a lot more than that. 

# Thank You

And 2 years on, the company has grown to be more than just the first 3 verticals. It hasn't been easy. Oh it has not. But I'm massively lucky to have the smartest friends, kindest people and most supportive family to keep me going. And then there's the community too. Some days, it really really really sucks. I feel like crap. And a random YouTube or Twitter or LinkedIn message on how they found the content useful really brightens my day up immediately. And that's just beautiful. 

Plenty of things working at the same time. Growing the company externally, internally, laterally and doubling down in the specific field. 4D chess. It can be exhausting, but I'm more obsessed every single day. 

What a privilege to be doing what I love, the reason for my existence and the purpose of my life. And how lucky I am, to be able to work with the brightest minds and work with the best team.

This is 100% impossible if it was just me. It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a country to start a company. Thank you to my parents, who are incredibly supportive. My dad sending me random newspaper clipping of Bitcoin and my mum really making the effort to figure out what the hell I am doing. 

And the insane amount of help from friends. I'm so lucky to have my smart friends. They are walking encyclopedia. Any questions or doubts I have, there are all these brilliant minds that I can tap into. The reason why I can explain things so well is because they have truly helped me to understand many of the things I don't know. I love my friends so much, and if there is an afterlife, I hope I find them again. 

My team. I remember days where I am fearful about hiring and today, I am most grateful to have some of the brightest minds to be working with ED! 

And there's the community that is the kindest, sweetest and most supportive of them all. I truly feel insanely blessed because I haven't had any hater experience (yet). The amount of constructive feedback, support and kindness is the most beautiful thing in the world. I feel so lucky to be able to share my knowledge and others finding value in it. It's not validation from people, more like feedback by the market that I'm on the right track. 

# Moving Forward

Every day is a step closer towards the 20 year plan. I am building an empire. And this is only just a start. I'm so proud to see how far ED has come. 1 year ago, I was struggling to share the idea with people. Today, I can articulate the growth of ED is a much clearer sense. I'm truly proud of what ED is becoming. 

Is the 3 years ago Lisa proud of the present Lisa? Hell yeah! And I know that Future Lisa is super supportive of the current Lisa today. Moving forward, we're going to change the world, one vertical at a time. The right direction every day, towards the 20 year goal. Here's to make the future slightly better, simply because we can. 

Love,
