It's always weird to notice the difference between how I parent Wesley and how my parents do. I think parenting is basically equipping the child with the right values, methodologies and principles so they can use them to be a value-adding citizen. 

Not everyone should be a parent. Most people should never be one. I'll never get those people who are shitty parents. 

# Parenting Styles

Anyway, these are values, methodologies and principles I focus on, when parenting Wesley. Wesley is 11 years younger, so I've got my hands on parenting Wesley with my parents and Xavier. 

- Time management. Time is what you can never get back. Plan your time, use them wisely. TIME TIME TIME
- Think long term. Plan ahead. What do you want at the end. Work backwards to figure out what resources you need to get there.
- Focus on methodology, not outcomes â€” learning methods, not grades. Passion, not salary options.
- Reflect. What did you do good. What did you do bad. Be critical about your actions. That's how you improve.
- Work hard. That is what makes the difference. Nothing comes easy. Work hard and you can figure out the rest after.
- Guide, not demand. If Wesley makes a mistake, explain why and teach him better methodology. Not to scold him and demand him to do something he dislikes. Only use the latter if he really misbehaves.
- Choose your circle. Remove negative influence, keep upgrading people around you. Add different segments of people into the circle.
- Prove with actions, not words. If Wesley wants something, he has to prove that he deserves it. Makes slides, show me numbers. Prove why he deserves it.
- Develop more than just grades. Play sports, learn something, explore outside of the classroom. Question everything.
- Money management. Save money (my mum is good at teaching this). Now, instead of spending it on airpods and a new iPhone, put that money somewhere to work for you.
- Travel and see the world. Travel abroad, giving him independence, asking him to do things on his own, question everything.
- Listen to what the inside is saying. Emotional health is equally important to grades.
- Pay for value, not price. Look at things from an investment perspective or the value it brings. Research before making a purchase. Check reviews, understand the usefulness. Wesley now researches different sites before deciding to purchase an item.
