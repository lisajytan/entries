Goodbye is the word I never want to learn in any language. If a time machine exists, please take me back to one year ago. I still remembered that 2D1N camp, although I really don't remember anything. And that’s where it all started.

# How I met everyone

Valentin invited me to Cansu’s camping x party in Sai Kung. The waters were icy cold and the winds howled at night. It was autumn then but the season does not stop us.

We reached the campsite early, set the tents and went to the sea. On the bus ride there, I learnt “bier auf wein das lass sein, wein auf bier das rat ich dir”. We had sangria, beers, red wine, white wine, vodka, so we all started with sangria and beers.

Long story short, that’s the night I met Fabio, Juong and Kimchi for the first time. I don’t remember meeting them and we had to reintroduce in the morning. I was rushing my report the day before and had 3 hours of sleep so I spent the most of the night sleeping in the tent.

We all met again, a week later, at the rooftop party for Yvonne’s birthday. That’s the night I met Grandma and Adam again. Fast forward a little more, I met Vanessa when the whole apartment smelt like blueberry.

> My dad told me, life is like a train. You have events determines the train stations in your life. People hop on and some get off at the next stop; some people stay forever.

These people, I’m sure, are going to stay on my train for a long long time. I’ll never let you leave.

# The Crazy Family

A grandma, a daddy, a mummy, a kimchi, a beef, a baby, a baby girl and a V.

Remember how it all started, with Fabio being baby on Yvonne’s birthday rooftop party. Then came The Alchemist's last gathering, where we went together. We hardly talked to anyone. People tried to join us for a chat, but left almost immediately because we were only talking among ourselves. The family started that night; the start of something beautiful.

Drunk decisions to hike to the peak at midnight to watch sunrise, hangover decisions to go to China together, Korean BBQ in winter, the F* park, the crazy Christmas party, grass island, New Year’s party, more hikes, TST’s rooftop, the time Juong almost miss his flight back to Germany, more house parties, birthday parties and camping. It is the crazy adventures that made me look forward to every single day.

Every time I go to a rooftop, I can't help but think about how I wish you guys were here with me. How I can hug everyone, how we'll prost before drinking, how one drink is never enough and how we will constantly be awed by the view. It's not the same, it just isn’t.

# Expiry Dates

One thing I learnt is that even beautiful things have an expiry date. When you have almost a year of fun-packed weekends *and weekdays* that's filled with pure love and craziness, it's definitely hard to say goodbye. Departure halls are one of the saddest places on earth.

There are so many moments where I wished I had a remote control to pause or at least slow time down; to recreate that memory; to extend time to live in that moment or just to be so absorbed in the moment. Time is equal for everyone, yet it is relative to each. Time with them seem to fly past without blinking an eye, yet time without has never been slower.

I thank the universe for all the small things that lead up to the wonderful relationships we made. Like what they say during graduation, this is not the end; it's only the beginning. May our plans come true and may we do all the crazy things again, this time in another part of the world.

I'll love you till the end of time, and you're forever in my hearts. I’ll always be here for you and I deliver what I promise.

With love to everywhere in the universe,The beef that you love. L
