Hey, just shout out to you all. Thank you! ✨💯

Almost all my meetings & emails start with “thank you for your videos”. Oh it genuinely makes my heart so full. I am still in disbelief that real humans watch and actually enjoy these nerdy things!!

Thank you for supporting me throughout the bad audio, the weird video effects and sometimes looking way too crappy in videos 😂 I listen to all your constructive feedbacks and I’m 100% appreciative of brutal honesty 😍

Still producing educational content and video to help you all understand more about the economics and science behind tokenisation and DeFi. I promise it can definitely be more than just a scam! Just taking a little more time for each video now because (1) lots to research & (2) 24h a day is not enough.

I hope the book (which I’m working on! Showing you all the content page soon) will help to complement all these things I’ve been talking about so far.

Thank you, you all. Best internet strangers in the world 😍✨

Guess social media (aka LinkedIn) isn't too bad after all 🔥😌

Love,

L
