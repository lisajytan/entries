They say it takes a village to raise a child. And I'll say it takes another village to start a company. The tremendous amount of help I've received to get to where I am today is insane. Sure, there is hard work on my part, but without the other key ingredients of support, people and opportunities, hard work is worthless. 

Yesterday, I had another happy tears moment. Whilst the company is not exactly *new*, it is still a baby in my eye. There are plenty of opportunities knocking every day and I'm just figuring things out. Plenty of new things, new lessons, new beginnings. Lots of known unknown and plenty more unknown unknowns. 

And with that, I'm most grateful for my village that stretches across many continents. The plenty of wonderful people helping, supporting and guiding me towards the bigger goal out there. I'm so grateful for that. I am the luckiest person in the entire world! 

My heart is full. Thank you. Thank you to people and their advice on hiring. Dave and his advice on company's partners. Spyros on setting the course up. Najah, Tuan Dinh and Tejas on proactiveness and tasks to do. Ohwen and Kevin on gov processes. Industry friends for relationships and connections. Non-industry friends for brainstorming and ideas. Book recommendations and podcasts. I'm only able to do what I do because I have the support from the village. 

> Thank you so much. Oh my heart! ❤️

Is this life's cheat code? To find the best people and work with them.
